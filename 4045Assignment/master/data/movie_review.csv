4960,"Sara Goldfarb is being harassed, literally, by her refrigerator in writer and director Darren Aronofsky's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Aronofsky, who rocketed to fame with his first indie film, PI, is back with a roller coaster ride about drug addition. It is an audacious film that will certainly win an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn, who plays Sara. And if there were any justice in the world, it would win one for Aronofsky as well. This movie, however, is the complete antithesis of a Hollywood production and so has little chance of being recognized with Best Picture or Best Director nominations.
First and foremost, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is an assault on our senses. Easily the most visually audacious movie of the year, its camerawork (Matthew Libatique) and editing (Jay Rabinowitz) are astounding. Approximating the effects of drugs on the brain, sometimes the film speeds up like a bullet train, and other times the action slows to a crawl. Especially effective are the close-up images of everything from drug preparation to pupil dilation to paper airplanes.
The cornucopia of images flow over our systems like a drug rush. We aren't merely witnessing the cataclysmic effects of drug addiction; we are experiencing them up close and personal. The director makes just the right choice in minimizing the surrealistic scenes in favor of speeding up the realistic ones.
>From the first frame, the director comes out swinging. The film doesn't really start, per se. Instead, we are thrown into a story that has been going on for a while. We feel much like viewers who have just turned on in the middle of a television series.
When we meet the angelic-looking Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), who loves his Ma, Sara, dearly and adores his girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), he is busy stealing his Ma's television. After pawning it, he buys drugs to get high with his friend, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans). His mother just heads down to the pawn dealer to buy it back again in a ritual that seems to have been going on since the dawn of time. Even if Burstyn's acting is the best of the bunch, all of the leads deliver probably the best performances of their careers.
Sad and lonely Sara has her own addiction, television, especially a motivational show starring Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). Its big rules on its road to nirvana include no red meat and no refined sugar. One day she is invited to come on the show sometime in the indefinite future. This causes Sara to move up the addiction chain. In order to get into her old red dress for the show, she goes to a diet doctor. (""How are you, Mrs. Goldfarb,"" the nurse asks perfunctorily, as Sara steps onto the scales. ""Enormous,"" she replies in embarrassment.) The doctor prescribes salvation in the form of a heavy regiment of diet drugs. Although losing weight initially makes her popular among the little old Jewish ladies that live in her building and wile away their days trying to soak up the sun, eventually it destroys her body and her mind.
Meanwhile Harry, Tyrone and Marion are busy devising a series of get-rich-quick schemes involving selling drugs. Harry brags to his Ma that he is working for ""sort of a distributor for a big importer."" So hyper with diet pill uppers that she looks in danger of exploding, she doesn't ask for any details. Their plans, however, are thwarted by their overriding need to consume what they are supposed to be selling. This puts them down a path of destruction that leaves them doing absolutely anything to get drugs to feed their habits. For Marion, the bottom of the pit occurs when she puts on a two woman sex show for a room filled with suits.
As the four of them descend into their own hells, it is hard to watch but impossible to look away. Caring deeply about each of the characters, we would no more turn away from them than we would a loved one. When the ending credits come, your audience will probably be like mine. No one moved or breathed. We were all frozen in our seats.
REQUIEM FOR A DREAM runs 1:42. It is not rated but would be NC-17 for drug usage, graphic images, nudity, sex and language and would be acceptable for college students and older.

2021,"Starring: Jodie Foster, Liam Neeson, Natasha Richardson, Richard Libertini, Nick Searcy Director: Michael Apted Producers: Renee Missel and Jodie Foster Screenplay: William Nicholson and Mark Handley based on the play ""Idioglossia"" by Mark Handley Cinematography: Dante Spinotti Music: Mark Isham Released by Twentieth Century Fox
NELL, Jodie Foster's return to dramatic acting following a flirtation with MAVERICK's action-comedy, is an entirely human movie. In this lush, green world of rolling hills and crystal pools, technology is an unwelcome intruder; civilization, a threatening monster. Both are slaves to the avaricious. NELL is about the importance of communication and interaction, about how the events of childhood shape a life, and about the difficulty--and rewards--of reaching out to others.
Nell (Foster) has lived her entire life alone in the woods with an aging mother. She is eventually discovered by a local doctor, Jerome Lovell (Liam Neeson), who comes to her secluded, ramshackle hut on the occasion of her mother's death. Nell's panicked and hostile response to strangers forces Jerome to travel to nearby Charlotte to recruit the expert assistance of Dr. Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson). After meeting the young woman, Paula's impression is that Nell should be committed. Jerome, horrified by this possibility, obtains a court order to stop it. The two opposing sides eventually argue the case before a judge. Deferring his verdict for three months, the judge gives the two doctors that time to observe their subject, learn her language, and present him with enough evidence to make an informed decision.
Jodie Foster's two Oscars are no fluke, as her simple-yet-profound performance in NELL illustrates. She is one of only a few actors capable of so fully immersing herself in a character that it's possible to forget the star behind the performance. With Jack Nicholson or Al Pacino, you watch a variation of the same personality; with Jodie Foster, you see a new individual.
Nell is an almost-childlike woman who speaks her own fractured form of English, hides inside her house by day, and takes moonlight swims in a nearby lake. In Jerome and Paula, she finds a substitute father and mother, and together, these three attempt to breach the non-physical walls between them. This, the real meat of NELL, is where the film attains its depth and richness.
At times, director Michael Apted, perhaps best known for his documentaries (the SEVEN UP series, INCIDENT AT OGLALA), seems as enamored with the scenery as with his actors. The North Carolina terrain is breathtaking, and Apted, along with cinematographer Dante Spinotti, has created one of the most beautiful motion pictures of the year. It's a wonderful background for this tale.
Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson are solid, but constantly in Foster's shadow. In a film as frequently introspective as NELL, it's refreshing not to have the three main actors struggling to outdo each other. The gentle, unforced tone, once established, is maintained--until the unfortunate climax.
Sadly, SCENT-OF-A-WOMAN disease has infected NELL. Perhaps the writers couldn't think of a better way out of an admittedly-difficult situation, but to pander to the ""Hollywood mentality"" of movie endings is a unworthy way to wrap up what is otherwise a finely-crafted motion picture. Had the majority of NELL not been so impressive, the lackluster final act wouldn't have been as disappointing.
Despite this moderate tarnish, it is difficult to deny NELL's intelligence and sensitivity. We approach this story with the same fascination that Nell faces each day, seeing, if only for a short time, how different the world--and people--can be. It is this impression more than any other that stays with the viewer after the drama has been played out and the final credits roll.

1440,"U.S. Availability: wide release on 2/10/95 Running Length: 1:45 MPAA Classification: R (Violence, language, mature themes)
Starring: Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio Director: Sam Raimi Producers: Joshua Donen, Allen Shapiro, and Patrick Markey Screenplay: Simon Moore Cinematography: Dante Spinotti Music: Alan Silvestri Released by TriStar Pictures
If movies were rated solely on the basis of style, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD would score highly indeed. With its dazzling photography, inventive camera angles, and throbbing bass score, the film is an experience for the eyes and ears. Director Sam Raimi (DARKMAN, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and cinematographer Dante Spinotti have woven a beautifully elaborate tapestry: colorful and evocative--and depressingly two-dimensional.
The spaghetti Western is not a genre that lends itself to great leaps of originality. Even the best of this genre tend to follow fairly familiar patterns. THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is no exception--indeed, it's so predictable that there's almost no opportunity for tension. Raimi's choice to give the film a comic book-like aura of mingled camp and grit makes for some fitfully energetic and entertaining moments, but it's not enough to overcome THE QUICK AND THE DEAD's primary fault.
Surprise isn't always necessary, of course, as long as there's a decent dramatic underpinning to the story. Such was the case in Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN. In THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, however, we have Sharon Stone in the lead role and, while she's good at looking peeved and delivering deadpan one-liners, her emotional range is limited. During a scene where she's crying in a graveyard, it's difficult for those in the audience to avoid grimacing. And where exactly did she get those designer sunglasses?
Stone plays Ellen, a female gunslinger who's out for blood. At the outset, we don't know exactly why (although it's possible to make a pretty good guess or two), but she's after John Herod (Gene Hackman), possibly the fastest gun around. Herod, along with fifteen others, has enrolled in the town of Redemption's quick-draw contest. The prize to the winner is $123,000, but Ellen is concerned far less about the money than her revenge. Now, all she has to do is bide her time and eliminate a few unsavory opponents along the way to a confrontation with Herod. Only one problem, though: she's scared to kill anyone.
Gene Hackman is, as usual, a joy to watch, even though he is essentially resurrecting a somewhat over-the-top version of Little Bill from UNFORGIVEN. Leonardo DiCaprio continues to show promise in a supporting role as Herod's unloved offspring, and Russell Crowe gives THE QUICK AND THE DEAD's best straight performance as a gunslinger-turned- preacher-turned-gunslinger-again.
Depending on how you count them, there are eleven or twelve gunfights in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. While these street duels are necessary staples of the Western, this film has a few too many and, despite Raimi's use of different angles and techniques, they get tiring long before the predictable, climactic showdown. All the nice ""little"" touches, such as the townspeople stripping corpses and a sight gag involving holes in bodies, don't make up for this repetition. The script just doesn't offer enough variety.
There's a lot of movement in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, but it's usually a case of going nowhere fast. While the film is too slick and flashy to allow boredom, there's little in the way of substance. Beneath the brightly-polished surface sheen, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD shows a distressingly hollow interior--and that's an unfortunate epitaph for any film's tombstone.
"
4766,"With a lovely wife and baby, a lucrative job, and an upper middle class home in the British suburbs, Chris, as he tells everyone, couldn't be happier. Too bad he doesn't believe it. Lately he's been talking long walks alone at night making voluminous mental lists ""'til the panic subsides."" Among other anxieties, he has become almost paralyzed with dreams of his long gone, youthful life across the Channel.
10 years ago, as a photographer living in Paris with a sexy French girlfriend, he boasted to his friends then of his complete bliss. The problem is that, just below the surface, he was as full of doubts then as now. And then, as now, he was blessed with a sensuous and supporting woman with whom he shared his dreams as well as some wild sex. (Okay, if truth be told, the current state of his marital sex life isn't what it was when he first got married.)
If ever a guy had it all, twice in fact, it is Chris. Philip Saville's METROLAND, set in 70's England and 60's Paris, is an insightful and intimate character study of Chris and the two loves of his life. Without explosive behavior, the finely tuned film challenges your mind rather than manipulating your emotions with the cheap theatrics typical of most films. In a stunning performance that is purposely shallow and ambiguous, Christian Bale becomes Chris. Never letting Chris degenerate into a caricature, Bale makes his character easy to empathize with.
Cutting back and forth between the two decades, you want Chris to stay with the one he's with at the time, and yet you can understand the emotions tugging him one way and then another. In some ways like Michael Apted's 35UP, the documentary that contrasts people's feelings about their life at various ages, METROLAND provides few easy answers. But it asks some pertinent and challenging questions.
As the story starts, Toni (Lee Ross), Chris's bosom buddy from his student days to his days in Paris, has come for his first visit in 5 years. Like an evil twin, Toni, who is jealous of Chris's success, taunts him for renouncing his former Bohemian lifestyle in favor of his new bourgeois success. Like the devil, Toni provides many temptations for Chris.
Emily Watson, after 2 juicy and high profile starring roles (BREAKING THE WAVES and HILARY AND JACKIE) that garnered her back-to-back Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, takes a crucial supporting role this time. Playing Chris's wife, Marion, Watson gives a preciseness and richness to a role that in lesser hands would fade into the background.
Chris is no match for Marion's intellect. She knows what she wants, and it is Chris for a husband. Not long after they meet, she remarks casually about his getting married someday. Shocked, he explains that he's a rebel who'll never be married. With complete confidence, she explains why he most certainly will be wed. ""You're not original enough not to,"" she tells him perspicaciously.
As his lovely, free-spirited, French girlfriend Annick, Elsa Zylberstein gives her character a sympathetic warmth that allows Annick to be much more than just an extended fling. The casting is ideal in that she is only modestly better looking than Marion, which makes Chris's indecision about something other than surface beauty.
METROLAND's strength comes from its remarkably sophisticated attitude about sexuality. The picture's completely natural portrayal of sex is funny, playful and quite erotic without ever being cheap or excessively explicit. Chris's first sexual encounter with Annick, with him being awkwardly overeager and her being lovingly supportive, is precious. Similarly, the pillow talk between Chris and Marion about some of their earlier, wild sexual encounters is sweet and humorous.
Adrian Hodges's intelligent script, based on the novel by Julian Barnes, is filled with real characters that never say anything that rings false. Hodges captures Chris's predicaments with delicate precision. Even the story's most minor characters are well drawn. One passenger on a train, for example, laments that this is his last ride on this route. He's been put out to pasture by the firm for whom he has worked for 42 years. His going away gift was a whiskey decanter. Sadly, he comments that, after that long, they should have realized that he didn't drink. The younger Chris discusses the origin of the name of the area, Metroland, with him. Chris says he wants to leave Metroland. ""It doesn't matter where you go,"" the man counsels him. ""Metroland isn't a place. It's a state of mind.""
The only disappointing aspects of the production are the cinematography and the music. The former is dull and dingy, and the latter is bland and uninspired. Absent these two, relatively minor criticisms, the film is an astute and intriguing story loaded with subtle but quite impressive acting.
After seeming to have no satisfactory conclusion, the movie ends quite well. As you leave the theater, you may begin to wonder how the rest of Chris's life will turn out. Remembering that it was just a movie, your thoughts may then turn to anticipation for these actors' next movies, hoping that their future films will be as rewarding and satisfying as this one.
METROLAND runs 1:45. It is not rated but might be an R for sex, nudity and profanity and would be acceptable for older and mature teenagers.

1372,"Cast: Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern, Kieran Culkin, B.D. Wong, Jane Adams Director: Charles Shyer Producer: Nancy Meyers Screenplay: Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers based on the screenplay for FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett Cinematography: William A. Fraker Music: Alan Silvestri U.S. Distributor: Touchstone Pictures
The curious thing about FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is that not only is it the sequel to a remake, but it's the remake of a sequel. As such, it's a perfect illustration of stretching an idea too far. Certain premises lack the necessary material for a multiple features, and this is one such example. As FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND (upon which this screenplay is based) paled in comparison to the original FATHER OF THE BRIDE, so this production is an uninspired follow-up to its immediate predecessor.
FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is proof that there's a limit to how much life can be coaxed from a feel-good formula. While the 1991 Steve Martin movie was good for ninety-plus minutes of undemanding fun, the second chapter is stale and overflowing with treacle. Shot by cinematographer William Fraker with warm, golden tones, it's a celebration of suburbia as the ultimate culmination of the ""American Dream.""
The overriding theme of this film is identical to that of the first FATHER OF THE BRIDE: letting go of a child. Previously, Steve Martin's George Banks had trouble accepting that his daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams), was ready to enter into a marriage with nice guy Brian MacKenzie (George Newbern). Here, when Annie announces that she's pregnant, George finds it difficult coming to grips with the realization that the baby will cement Brian and Annie's family, further distancing him from his beloved daughter. A secondary issue is briefly raised about George coping with the approach of his fiftieth birthday, but it's quickly dropped after George learns that not only is he about to be a grandfather, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is going to have their third child.
I have often said that, in a comedy, much silliness and sappiness can be forgiven in the service of solid humor. But, while FATHER OF THE BRIDE has a few genuinely funny moments, it spends entirely too much time trying to be dramatic. The result is that the recycled sentiment becomes overwhelming -- so much so that Martin himself jokingly refers to his clan as the ""schmaltz family."" Trite lines like ""Thanks for marrying me, Nina"" and ""Life isn't gonna get much better than this"" pepper the screenplay.
Martin and Keaton are appealing separately and together, but their relationship got all the development it needed in part one; here, they're treading water, trying to keep the film afloat by sheer screen presence. It's not enough. Kimberly Williams all-but-fades into the background. Outside of her scenes with Martin, she's pretty much invisible. Would that the same could be said about the duo of Martin Short and B.D. Wong (reprising their roles from part one), whose exaggerated accents and mannerisms go far beyond being irritating -- and scenes with these two are supposed to be comic highlights... To add insult to injury, Eugene Levy is on hand as a caricature of a greedy Arab who's almost as offensive as Short's Franck Eggelhoffer. One bright spot is Jane Adams' on-target portrayal of a competent obstetrician.
In the Age of Family Values, FATHER OF THE BRIDE II will be welcomed with open arms by the likes of Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole (who will probably praise it without seeing it). There's nothing ""morally indecent"" about the film -- no profanity, no sex outside marriage, and a healthy dose of hugs and smiles. That FATHER OF THE BRIDE II isn't a particularly engrossing motion picture won't make much difference to that crowd. Or, judging by the enthusiastic audience response, to the portion of the American public that laps up whatever Hollywood puts out, regardless of how unoriginal and artistically empty the product is.

2490,"Starring: Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan, James Caan, Gwyneth Paltrow. Screenplay/Director: Steve Kloves.
It's about fifteen minutes into FLESH AND BONE before you see the first speck of sunlight, or hear the first note of underscore. In fact, there's almost no movement or sound of any kind. It's clear from the outset that writer/director Steve Kloves (THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS) is going for a dark and moody feel. However, there's moody, and then there's comatose. FLESH AND BONE is the perfect example of a solid story choking nearly to death on its own atmosphere.
FLESH AND BONE opens with a rural Texas family taking in an apparently homeless boy for the night. In fact, the boy is the son of a thief who has fequently pulled this con, letting his dad into homes after everyone is asleep. This time, the robbery is botched and three members of the family are slain, leaving only an infant girl. Thirty years later, grown-up Arlis Sweeney (Dennis Quaid) is eking out a living running a vending machine supply business, content with a simple, predictable life. While on a job, he meets Kay Davies (Meg Ryan), a runaway wife jumping drunkenly out of a cake at a bachelor party. Arlis brings Kay along on his rounds, and an attraction grows. Trouble also grows when Papa Roy (James Caan) reappears, linked up with a slick young grifter (Gwyneth Paltrow). Despite every attempt to distance himself from his past, Arlis finds himself drawn into his father's obsession with tying up loose ends.
At the heart of FLESH AND BONE is an intriguing character in an intriguing premise. Arlis Sweeney is a man desperately trying to convince himself that he's not like his father, trying to live out his days meekly as a personal penance for whatever crimes he might have been party to. He feels completely unworthy of the too-trusting Kay, giving their relationship a nice dynamic. Unfortunately, Dennis Quaid is playing Arlis. As charming as he can be, Quaid simply doesn't have the dramatic range necessary to dig into this complicated character; when he should be looking introspective and guilt-ridden, he just looks stiff. I was left imagining a Jeff Bridges in the role, and what might have been given a more versatile actor.
Other aspects of the performances also left me unsatisfied. Meg Ryan has the light touch required for the film's few moments of humor, but she doesn't quite strike the balance of strength and accumulated pain required for this role. James Caan has a surprisingly small part, given his prominence in the advertising campaign, and never quite hits his stride. His performance is too mannered, full of odd jaw movements and rolled eyes. It's a major drawback, because Caan's Roy is supposed to be FLESH AND BONE's living manifestation of evil, and he's nowhere near threatening enough. Surprisingly, the best performance is turned in by Gwyneth Paltrow as the savvy Gennie, but it's hard to figure what purpose her character serves, other than perhaps to remind Arlis of what he could be.
For all the problems with the acting, it's another issue entirely that proves to be FLESH AND BONE's ultimate undoing: it's positively snore-inducing. At two hours and ten minutes, it's at *least* twenty minutes too long. The second act is interminable, chock full of scenes best left on the cutting room floor, like Kay's confrontation with her husband (apparently a refugee from THELMA AND LOUISE). There were establishing shots which lasted twice as long as necessary, and meaningful pauses which weren't very meaningful. To make matters worse, there were two minute stretches of dialogue between Caan and Quaid which were practically indecipherable (I'm not sure whether to blame the sound mixing or the theater for that one). In live theater, there is an expression: ""Tighten it up."" What FLESH AND BONE needed was a good tightening up.
The tone that FLESH AND BONE is going for is fully achieved. The West Texas locations are expertly captured by cinematographer Phillippe Rousselot, and the spare score by Thomas Newman has a nice edgy feel. Everything is working towards a grim tension, and it succeeds, but tension requires release and it's there that FLESH AND BONE doesn't deliver. Thanks to an ill-conceived ad campaign, one of the film's key plot points is given away in the trailers, blowing one of those release points for anyone who has seen them. There is a great deal of craft to the broad strokes of FLESH AND BONE. However, in this tale of evil, the devil is truly in the lack of details.

2204,"Starring: Jeni Courtney, Mick Lally, Richard Sheridan, Eileen Colgan, John Lynch Director: John Sayles Producers: Sarah Green and Maggie Renzi Screenplay: John Sayles based on THE SECRET OF THE RON MOR SKERRY by Rosalie K. Fry Released by Skerry Movies Corporation
In content, setting, and cast choice, THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is a departure for writer/director John Sayles. The creative force behind such memorable and diverse films as MATEWAN, CITY OF HOPE, EIGHT MEN OUT, and PASSION FISH, has taken pen and camera across the Atlantic to Ireland, a land steeped in mystery and legend. There, using the folklore of the locals, he has brought to life an enchanting story about magic and tradition that is suitable for family viewing.
Before embarking on his adaptation of Rosalie K. Fry's out-of-print children's book, Sayles spent time researching the customs and language of the place where this film was to be set. His intention, from the beginning, was to create a picture in which Irish actors would not be given dialogue that seemed obviously written by a foreigner.
THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is the story of 10-year old Fiona Coneelly (Jeni Courtney), a motherless girl living in the city who is sent to stay with her grandparents (Mick Lally and Eileen Colgan) when her father determines that his poor lifestyle is not suitable for raising a daughter. Fiona's grandparents live in a small fishing village across the waters from Roan Inish (""seal island""), the island where the Coneellys had thrived for generations until tragic circumstances forced them to the mainland. Now, however, legends about the family's connection to Roan Inish abound. Is Fiona's little brother, who drifted out to sea in a storm years ago, really dead, or have the seals nurtured and protected him? Is there any truth to the story that in Fiona's veins runs the blood of a selkie, a seal who became a woman? And what will it take to restore the ways of the past, something which inspires equal portions of longing and dread?
Geographically, Sayles may be in unfamiliar territory with THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH, but his inimitable style has been imprinted on this movie. Two of the director's trademarks--the ability to tell an engrossing story and the development of strong, three-dimensional characters -- are in evidence. With ROAN INISH, Sayles has found the perfect balance between the mystical and the concrete. Much like INTO THE WEST, the result is exuberant and compelling.
None of the actors in THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH are likely to be familiar to American viewers. Mick Lally, who does a wonderful job as the grandfather, is an accomplished Irish thespian whose work is rarely seen overseas. Jeni Courtney, another impressive child actor, has never before done a screen role. Her fiery performance is as much a testimony to her talent as to Sayles' direction.
There's no doubt that THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is a most atypical motion picture, but in many ways, this is the best kind of movie -- one that takes us to a land where magic is real, and where a little girl can strive to find a lost brother and bring happiness to an entire family. The story, although straightforward, is by no means simple, and there's enough in THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH to delight both children and adults.

1567,"United States/Ireland, 1997 U.S. Release Date: 10/3/97 (wide) Running Length: 1:35 MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Profanity, mature themes) Theatrical Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1
Cast: Janeane Garofalo, David O'Hara, Milo O'Shea, Denis Leary, Jay O. Sanders, Rosaleen Linehan, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Saffron Burrows Director: Mark Joffe Producers: Eric Fellner, Tim Bevan, Luc Roeg Screenplay: Karen Janszen, Louis Nowra, Graham Linehan based on a screenplay by Greg Dinner Cinematography: Ellery Ryan Music: John Altman U.S. Distributor: Gramercy Pictures
The production notes trumpet THE MATCHMAKER as ""a romantic comedy for people who hate romantic comedies."" This statement implies that the film has something exceptionally original or daring to offer those who are tired of screen love affairs that follow a predictable trajectory from point A to point B. In fact, it's false advertising. There's nothing remotely special about the romantic component of this picture -- it's strictly boy meets girl, boy loses girl due to a silly misunderstanding, and boy gets back together with girl in time for the end credits.
So why would anyone who hates romantic comedies like this one? Presumably because the film makers believe that Janeane Garofalo is the type of atypical leading lady who will attract a more cynical audience. And, while this might have been true before THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS, Garofalo is widely remembered for her role as Abby the animal lover, and her presence in another romantic comedy will not surprise anyone. Indeed, she shows the same unselfconscious charm in THE MATCHMAKER that made her character so irresistible in CATS AND DOGS. The primary difference is that the script for this film has a confused sense of what it wants to accomplish, and, as a result, director Mark Joffe (COSI) is unable to utilize Garofalo's talents fully.
The film begins conventionally enough. Garofalo plays Marcy Tizard, the tireless political aide to Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders), who's running for re-election in Massachusetts. He's behind in the polls, however, so his campaign manager, the hard-bitten Nick Ward (Denis Leary), comes up with a new strategy that involves sending Marcy overseas to the town of McGlory's ancestors, a place called Ballinagra in Ireland's County Galway. While there, she's supposed to find a few of McGlory's relatives (the intention being to bolster his support in Boston's Irish American community). Marcy isn't thrilled about making the trip, but, since she has no life, she agrees.
While the setup may be a little long-winded, it succeeds in getting Marcy to Ireland, where she arrives in the midst of a matchmaking festival and is presented with the opportunity to find love with one of the locals. (Of course, as with most romantic comedies, we know who her match is the moment that we see him.) Unfortunately, instead of just allowing the story to coast along through familiar romantic comedy terrain, the film makers choose to bring back the political sideshow during the final half-hour. This might have been okay had the material been well-written, but it's all trite and derivative. THE MATCHMAKER's script doesn't offer one observation about the American political process that hasn't been presented many times before, frequently in better movies. Worse still, as this aspect of the plot attains pre- eminence during the closing twenty minutes, Marcy and her romantic situation are crowded out. Maybe the reason romantic comedy haters are supposed to appreciate this film is because, after a hour's buildup, the love story gets shortchanged. At the precise moment when Marcy and her would-be Irish beau, Sean (David O'Hara), should be THE MATCHMAKER's focus, they're standing off to the side.
Despite the uneven and potentially-dissatisfying screenplay, there are still a few reasons to see THE MATCHMAKER, chief of which is a trio of finely-tuned performances from Garofalo, David O'Hara (an Irish actor who has appeared in the likes of SOME MOTHER'S SON and BRAVEHEART), and screen and stage veteran Milo O'Shea, who plays Dermot, the local matchmaker. Also, since the movie was shot on location in Ireland, a dash of the local color and scenery gets thrown into the mix, and there don't seem to be as many stereotypes as one might normally expect from a production of this nature.
Had THE MATCHMAKER been better focused, it might have resembled THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN with gender and location changes. However, while the romantic stuff here works, the unsavvy and unappealing political material proves to be a constant irritant (and leads to the film's worst moment -- a short, preachy speech on ethics delivered in strident tones by Garofalo). As a result, the movie's marriage of true love and cynical campaigning turns out to be less than a match made in heaven.

Hey, did you ever hear the one about the really good post-SCREAM teen horror film? It seems that some film-makers, realizing there was a new market to be tapped after the success of SCREAM and its sequel, decided to make an even better variation on the theme. The script was intelligent, the obligatory pop culture asides felt more than obligatory, and the suspense was genuinely scary. It was both fresh _and_ frightening. No, really, it actually happened. A friend of my cousin's sister-in-law actually saw it.
Sorry, friends, but the preceding is a myth -- an URBAN LEGEND if you will, exactly the kind which forms the basis of the film of the same name. You see, the story on the Northeastern U.S. campus of Pendleton College goes that a psycho professor murdered a dorm full of students 25 years ago, but the administration hushed it up. Now, as the silver anniversary approaches, more nastiness is going on. A young woman is decapitated by a figure in the back seat of her car; another is killed in a darkened room while her rommate lies blissfully sleeping. All of it is somehow connected to Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt), a student with a dark secret in her past, but who is murdering students based on urban legends? Hot shot school reporter Paul (Jared Leto)? Frat boy prankster Damon (Joshua Jackson)? Folklore professor Wexler (erstwhile Freddy Krueger Robert Englund)? Or some other disgruntled soul?
If you actually care about the answer to that question by the end of URBAN LEGEND, it will only be to see how convoluted the explanation could be. Like too many recent horror films, this one obliges you to play Name That Killer, without giving you enough information to permit anything but a random guess. And if you think abut the revelation for long enough afterwards, you'll realize it just doesn't matter. Memo to horror film-makers: we don't need to be guessing who's behind Michael Myers' mask in order for him to be threatening. Stop wasting our time; this is a slasher film, not Agatha Christie.
Frankly, it's about time slasher films started acting like slasher films in plenty of ways. Ever since SCREAM (or even Wes Craven's earlier NEW NIGHTMARE, if you wanna be picky), horror films have gone all post-modern on us, eschewing grind-it-out gore in favor of winking recognition of genre conventions. URBAN LEGEND's pop culture nuggets range from the acceptably smirky (a snippet of the ""Dawson's Creek"" theme played when ""Dawson's Creek"" cast member Jackson turns on his car radio) to the who-cares ridiculous (naming one character after one of the film's producers), and those are only a couple of examples of the strained reaches for gags in Silvio Horta's script. There's just not enough humor or creativity to compensate for the raw terror lost in forced attempts to be cute. Aside from the effective prologue sequence, URBAN LEGEND misses the boat on providing gut-level scares.
Ironically enough, it also misses the point that most of the late 70s/early 80s slasher films these arched-eyebrow cousins goof on were actually moralizing cautionary tales, just like the ones described by Englund's folklore professor. When he asks his class if they know the one about the babysitter who gets a call from inside the house, many movie fans will say yes...it was called WHEN A STRANGER CALLS. URBAN LEGEND nicks from the cine-literate horror of SCREAM without even realizing it, because movies _are_ our urban legends. The film might have been on to something with a killer copycatting other movie murders, rather than trying to pass off the ever-popular ""impaled on the parking lot tire spikes"" tale as part of the collective unconscious, or giving us the Nanook of the North terror of a killer hidden behind a zipped-up parka. Pity the talented Alicia Witt (late of TV's ""Cybill"") for getting caught up in a horror film that's not clever enough or scary enough to succeed as anything but a clutch-your-date Friday night special. URBAN LEGEND is a tale too often told. And as one character in the film says, ""If you're going to tell the story, at least get it right.""

2901,"(20th Century Fox) Starring: Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche, Gaby Hoffman, Don Cheadle. Screenplay: Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray. Producers: Neal H. Moritz and Andrew Z. Davis. Director: Mick Jackson. MPAA Rating: PG-13 (profanity, violence, adult themes) Running Time: 103 minutes. Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
It's hard to believe it has been over two and a half months since the last volcano movie hit North American screens; it seems like only, gosh, seven or eight weeks. 20th Century Fox is banking on the fact that lava's lovelier the second time around, rolling out VOLCANO as an April preview to the summer movie season, but whether or not it works depends on what you're looking for in your disaster movies. DANTE'S PEAK was frequently dumb and predictable, but it also delivered suspense down the stretch in well-packaged bursts. VOLCANO is less chained to convention, a bit more clever, and boasts a more talented cast. It is also more about spectacle than suspense, a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from a detached distance than it is to get caught up in.
Tommy Lee Jones stars as Mike Roark, a supervisor for Los Angeles' Office of Emergency Management who is supposed to be on vacation with his daughter Kelly (Gaby Hoffman). That is before a moderate earthquake hits, and before an incident involving the death of several utilities workers suggests an unusual underground heat source. Seismologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) has a theory, but no one believes it -- that is, until the La Brea Tar Pits turn into a fountain of magma spewing destruction all over Wilshire Boulevard. As the sea of lava begins its inexorable march, Roark tries to figure out some way to stop it or re-direct its course. Meanwhile, Dr. Barnes suggests that there may be another more powerful eruption yet to come, and tries to figure out where and when it might hit.
There are certain elements you have come to expect in a film of this kind, and VOLCANO delivers all of them: intransigent bureaucrats who end up making a bad situation worse, a hero whose personal life is given equal footing with large-scale destruction, pets which make improbable escapes. Fortunately, the script by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray offers a few variations on those themes along the way. The intransigent bureaucrat, instead of becoming the guy whose inevitable death is a cause for cheers, gets a shot at redemption; those amazing animals are given a satirical poke in a feel-good TV news piece about ""the other victims."" The dialogue sometimes does get stilted and heavy-handed, and a few of the sub-plots -- including one involving a self-absorbed real estate developer (John Corbett) -- are abandoned mid-stream without any fanfare. Apparently someone realized that a fast pace and minimal exposition make for a better disaster.
That doesn't prevent the writers from attempting some clumsy stabs at social commentary, which are notable largely because they are among the few attempts at making the film specific to L.A. As dopey as the tag line ""The Coast is Toast"" may be, it showed that the marketing people understood one of the more appealing elements of VOLCANO's premise: people want to get a perverse charge out of watching Tinseltown become Tindertown. VOLCANO could have used more of a sense of place, more recognizable landmarks like the Angelyne billboard turned into briquets. Sure, it's wonderful that racially-fragmented Los Angelenos become one big ashen can't-we-all-just-get-along family when forced to work together for the common weal, but be honest. Wouldn't you rather see lava creeping up on a trademark L.A. traffic jam or chasing an army of suddenly less mellow in-line skaters through Santa Monica, instead of crawling like fluorescent tapioca down Wilshire?
Which is not to say that the fluorescent tapioca in question isn't extremely impressive. In fact, there are a lot of impressive visuals in VOLCANO, including tactically launched lava bombs and a dizzying array of explosions. The pyrotechnicians earn every cent of their pay in VOLCANO, but the imagery could have been accompanied by more tense set pieces. One superb sequence finds Jones and Heche dangling over lava from a fire truck ladder, while a man lying on the ladder contends with a fire burning its way up a hose. However, that's one of the rare moments when anyone seems to be in any genuine peril. The lava gets rolling, it destroys a bunch of buildings, folks try to figure out how to stop it, and then they try to figure out _another_ way to stop it. VOLCANO loses a lot of steam after Mount Wilshire blows her top, but there's just enough magnificent magma to carry it through until Randy Newman sings ""I Love L.A."" over the closing credits. I love L.A., too, though I might have preferred it even more well-done.

2200,"Starring: Jeff Bridges, Edward Furlong, Lucinda Jenny, Tracey Kapisky, Don Harvey, Melvyn Hayward Director: Martin Bell Producers: Rosilyn Heller and Jeff Bridges Screenplay: Peter Silverman Music: James Newton-Howard; songs by Tom Waits Released by Triton Pictures
Jack Kelson (Jeff Bridges) is an ex-con just out of jail, trying to get his new chance at life off to a good start. Unfortunately, circumstances conspiring against him. His fourteen year old son Nick (Edward Furlong) has run away from Jack's sister's farm, where he was staying, and has sought out his father. At first, Jack seeks to send the boy back, but when Nick won't budge, he has no choice but to let him stay. Their relationship is strained, however, and Jack isn't a very good role model. With each passing day, problems mount, and the easy money offered by Jack's old way of life becomes a temptation increasingly more difficult to resist.
It's a gross disservice to AMERICAN HEART to describe it thematically as a ""white BOYZ 'N THE HOOD"", but that phrase gets across the kind of story that director Martin Bell and screenwriter Peter Silverman are trying to tell. This movie is about the life of poor whites struggling to make it in the inner city. The setting is Seattle, but it could just as easily be any other city in the United States. As was true with BOYZ, the problems--and their lack of solutions--are universal.
Set against the backdrop of poverty and violence is the father-and-son relationship which forms the core of the movie. Jack and Nick don't have a great rapport, but as the movie progresses, they struggle to find some sort of connection. Jack doesn't know how to be a good parent, and really doesn't want to start trying, but it's obvious that he loves his kid and wants Nick to have better opportunities than he had.
All three subplots are as engaging as the main story. One, which follows the development of Jack's affair with Charlotte, a female pen-pal (Lucinda Jenny) he started corresponding with while in prison, is exceptionally well-written, especially considering the dynamics that her presence adds to the already-uncertain father/son relationship. Nick resents Charlotte's presence, feeling that she is taking away time that Jack should be spending with him.
As the film progresses, Nick gets a girlfriend of his own--Molly (Tracey Kapisky), a fifteen year old streetwalker whose mother is a topless dancer. Molly introduces Nick to, among other things, drugs and crime. Despite Jack's warnings that she'll break his heart, Nick can't stay away from her. She's as addictive as the Marijuana that he smokes with her.
Then there's the constant re-appearance of Jack's old partner, Rainey (Don Harvey), who wants either Jack or Nick to accompany him on his next job--the robbery of a jewelry store. Considering the poor state of Jack's finances, it's a tempting offer, but he realizes that to attain his modest dream of traveling north to set up a life in Alaska, he has to keep his hands clean. Whether Nick can resist the lure of ""easy money"" is another matter altogether.
AMERICAN HEART throws formulas out the window. When you expect something to happen, don't be sure that it will. There's certainly no adherence to a Hollywood-type resolution. The atmosphere throughout this film is stark, but the tone is not so relentlessly bleak that it disallows a little humor. Given the dark nature of the movie, each of the few lighthearted moments is needed.
Jeff Bridges, who has shown a capacity for playing grungy, downtrodden men throughout his career, gives an excellent performance here. Jack is the kind of man you can sympathize with--a villain trying to go straight, and you can see and feel him through the image that Bridges presents. While this probably isn't the actor's career role, he brings his character to life, infusing him with believability and energy.
Would that Edward Furlong does as well with Nick. Furlong, whose top roles to date have come in a couple films demanding little in the acting department (TERMINATOR 2 and PET SEMETARY 2), displays his lack of ability in AMERICAN HEART. For the most part, he has two modes: a blank face and a peeved expression. Anything else is a bonus. Perhaps it's just a case of underplaying every scene. Fortunately, few scenes demand that Furlong carry them, and he has a fine supporting cast to keep audience recognition of his faults to a minimum.
AMERICAN HEART is the kind of hard-hitting, issue-confronting drama that are few and far between these days. The film is in limited distribution, so it may be difficult to find but, given the opportunity, it's definitely worth a look.

2730,"(New Line) Starring: Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner. Screenplay: Mike Myers. Producers: Suzanne Todd, Demi Moore, Jennifer Todd, Mike Myers. Director: Jay Roach. MPAA Rating: PG-13 (profanity, adult themes) Running Time: 87 minutes. Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
Boy, did AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY take me back. Not to 1967, when I was a mere babe in arms, but to those carefree, halcyon days of 1990. George Bush was still flying high in the approval ratings, GHOST was making millions of Americans ""believe,"" and Mike Myers was a cast member of a still-popular ""Saturday Night Live."" Myers provided some moments of comic genius in those days, even as the show was developing this habit of allowing sketches to exceed their welcome by several excruciating minutes. I was reminded of both aspects of 1990-era ""SNL"" as I watched AUSTIN POWERS: Myers' appeal, and the inability to recognize when enough is enough.
AUSTIN POWERS opens in 1967, where the title character (Mike Myers) is a legendary fashion photographer, secret agent and ladies man, battling arch-nemesis Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) alongside his partner Mrs. Kensington (Mimi Rogers). When Austin thwarts yet another of Dr. Evil's plans, the criminal mastermind has himself cryogenically preserved and launched into space to await another opportunity for evil. Thirty years later, Dr. Evil returns to earth, but the joke is on him: Austin Powers has _also_ had himself frozen, and is thawed out to take on his old foe. Together with Mrs. Kensington's daughter Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley), Austin tries to stop Dr. Evil from blackmailing the nations of the world, while also trying to adjust to a world with different sexual mores, different fashions, and better oral hygiene.
AUSTIN POWERS is a parody which could have run out of gas in seconds if Myers had been interested only in late 60s anachronisms. As it turns out, there are relatively few gags based on the culture shock of the hero and the villain. For the most part, AUSTIN POWERS is a fairly straightforward parody of James Bond-ian secret agent adventures, with gags more amusing than their obviousness gives them any right to be. Austin's British Intelligence superior (Michael York), whose only purpose is to explain the plot, is named Basil Exposition; the buxom femme fatale is suggestively named Alotta...well, the last name completes the picture. Myers energizes all these ideas with an odd-ball edge and the sheer exuberance of his performance in both roles. It's not possible to do justice to Dr. Evil's self-revelations in a father/son encounter group, or the ""erotic"" dance with which Austin subdues a horde of lethal female robots.
As long as AUSTIN POWERS feels vaguely original, and doesn't remind you of ""Saturday Night Live,"" it's actually very funny. Unfortunately, if you watched Myers-era ""SNL"" at all, it's going to look awfully familiar. The characterization of Dr. Evil is a cross between Myers' Dieter character and Ed Sullivan; Austin is a grown-up version of his naughty British schoolboy Simon. He invokes his loud-mouthed thespian from ""Theater Stories"" in one early scene, and in another does a nearly word-for-word re-creation of a bit from a ""Wayne's World"" sketch. He seems so enamored of invoking memories of ""SNL,"" in fact, that he invokes nightmares of jokes which refuse to die. On at least five separate occasions, Myers and director Jay Roach seem to have no sense of how long is too long to stick with an extended gag. They usually feel something like this: funny for five seconds, not funny for ten seconds, funny for five more seconds, not funny for eight and a half minutes.
After so many begging-to-be-pulled-from-life-support sequences, AUSTIN POWERS feels like one of the most padded 87 minute movies you'll ever see. It didn't need to be. The early scenes set in 1967 are hilarious, including a goofy opening credits sequence and the promise of nice repartee between Myers and Mimi Rogers as the Emma Peel-like Mrs. Kensington. Every time ""Laugh-In""-style musical blackout segments appeared between scenes, I thought about how much funnier AUSTIN POWERS might have been as a pure period piece. It's the character of Austin Powers and the familiar plot elements from early James Bond films which are most appealing about AUSTIN POWERS; there was no particular need to put those elements in the 1990s. But that's what we've got: a comedy which jettisons a great premise for a merely adequate one. Myers alone may be reason enough to watch AUSTIN POWERS if you are a fan of his ""SNL"" glory days. There will be plenty of chances in the film to flash back to those days...and if you remember them at all, you know what a mixed blessing that could be.

1206,"In his last film, 1993's THE METEOR MAN, director Robert Townsend (THE FIVE HEARTBEATS) simultaneously paid homage to and satirized comic book superheroes. This time out, he's attempting to do much the same thing with fairy tales. Or, more precisely, with one fairy tale -- that of ""Cinderella."" Only here, instead of glass slippers, horse-drawn carriages, and prince charming, we have stiletto heels, Rolls Royces, and a genial, terminally ill gent played by Oscar winner Martin Landau.
B.A.P.S. (which stands for ""black American princesses"") is a lightweight, minimally entertaining piece which represents a marginal improvement over THE METEOR MAN. The film is severely flawed (due primarily to a shocking lack of imagination and creativity), but it is more watchable than this year's other would-be modern-day fairy tale, Fran Drescher's awful THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST. In B.A.P.S., at least some of the jokes are funny and the serious moments aren't galling.
The premise of this film is, as you might expect, rather thin. The main characters are two young black women of little note whose dreams are wasting away in their home town of Decatur, Georgia. Nisi (Halle Berry with blonde hair and gold-capped teeth) and Mickey (newcomer Natalie Desselle) hope one day to be able to open a combined beauty salon/restaurant, but, in order to do so, they need a lot of money. So, when they spy an ad for the ""Video Dance Girl of the World"" contest (first prize: $10,000), they ditch their do-nothing boyfriends and hop on a plane to L.A. But, although they lose the contest, they catch the eyes of a couple of con men who offer them $10,000 plus room and board in an East Beverly Hills mansion if they'll be nice to dying Mr. Blakemore (Martin Landau). The butler, a crusty British type named Manley (Ian Richardson) is suspicious of them, and watches their every move like a hawk.
While I realize that the plot of B.A.P.S. is designed as nothing more than a frame for jokes and gags, it still annoys me when any film proceeds along such dull and predictable lines. Would it have been that difficult to inject something new or moderately adventurous into the film? Instead, what we get is a double variation of the fish out of water scenario folded into the ""Cinderella"" envelope. While Nisi and Mickey struggle to find their footing in the aristocratic world of Beverly Hills (there's an obligatory bidet scene that's supposed to be a lot funnier than it actually is), butler Manley learns to let down his hair. We've seen it all before.
At least the cast is mostly solid. Martin Landau's abilities are sorely wasted here, but the other three principals are used to good effect. Halle Berry, despite the distracting hair color, is her usual affable self, making Nisi a great deal more likable than she probably was on paper. Ian Richardson, the terrific British actor whose career role was that of the deliciously despicable Francis Urquhart in three mini-series (HOUSE OF CARDS, TO PLAY THE KING, and THE FINAL CUT), is perfectly cast as the snobbish butler. The humor in the Manley-goes- shopping-for-rap-CDs is due entirely to Richardson's no-nonsense performance. Finally, there's first-timer Natalie Desselle, who has the comic energy and physical presence of a young Nell Carter.
Townsend elected to shoot the entire film using a soft focus technique that creates an omnipresent glow. While this emphasizes the fairy tale quality of the story, it does little to hide the deficiencies of Troy Beyer's flimsy script. An interesting cast is only half the battle, and, from the moment he chose such a derivative screenplay, the director lost the other half. The best Townsend can do with B.A.P.S. is go for cheap, easy laughs (the aforementioned bidet scene being a good example of this). Paying movie-goers deserve more, especially from someone who has previously shown signs of genuine comic aptitude.

1241,"Cast: Martin Donovan, John A. MacKay, Michael Finesilver, Fritz Fox Director: Eran Palatnik Producers: Eran Palatnik, Alan Abrams Screenplay: Richard Lee Purvis Cinematography: Zach Winestine Music: Robert Een
THE ROOK is a lackluster murder mystery that transpires in a bizarre alternate reality. Hal Hartley regular, Martin Donovan (TRUST, SIMPLE MEN, AMATEUR), plays John Cross, a by-the-book detective investigating the murder of a female linguistics professor. Cross' world is a mixture of the modern and the archaic. Rooms are lit by electric lights, computers are available for crime investigators, but the most common form of transportation is still the horse-drawn carriage. England is in the midst of a revolution, with government forces having already lost Greenwich.
Cross' inquiries lead him deeper into the murky politics of the revolution, and this is where the story begins to lose coherence. Not only does THE ROOK's plot become difficult to follow, but the murder mystery lacks twists, red herrings, or surprises. It's too straightforward, and Cross' character isn't interesting enough to keep us involved during such a pedestrian investigation.
THE ROOK is effectively atmospheric, and there are occasional scenes that function as pointed political commentary, but the main story doesn't work. The film is dull when it should be engrossing, and the material is stretched ridiculously thin to reach feature length. Donovan, who typically plays understated roles, virtually vanishes into obscurity -- Cross has no personality.
Had THE ROOK spent more time exploring its unusual setting, the results might have been more satisfying. As it is, however, the strange technological disparities and offbeat social climate become little more than window dressing for the pedestrian plot. Even the lamest stories on PBS' MYSTERY offer more genuine suspense than director Eran Palatnik's sub-par effort.

1323,"Cast: Alec Baldwin, Mary Stuart Masterson, Kelly Lynch, Teri Hatcher, Eric Roberts, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Samantha Lagpacan Director: Phil Joanou Producers: Leslie Greif, Andre E. Morgan, and Albert S. Ruddy Screenplay: Harley Peyton and Scott Frank based on the novel by James Lee Burke Cinematography: Harris Savides Music: George Fenton U.S. Distributor: New Line Cinema/Savoy Pictures
HEAVEN'S PRISONERS tries very hard not to admit what it really is. By throwing a tangled web of incoherent subplots into the mix, screenwriters Harley Peyton and Scott Frank (GET SHORTY), adapting James Lee Burke's novel, have cleverly concealed the fact that this movie is actually a revenge thriller. Unfortunately, this camouflage has resulted in an overlong, convoluted story that's of limited entertainment value. Had director Phil Joanou (FINAL ANALYSIS) attempted something in the more straightforward style of DEATH WISH, his picture might have worked better. It certainly wouldn't have dragged on for more than two hours.
It's inevitable that, in any movie featuring an alcoholic ex-cop who starts the film on the wagon, there will be some point when he takes a drink. This is just one of many cliches employed by HEAVEN'S PRISONERS. The ex-cop is Dave Robicheaux (Alec Baldwin), a one-time lieutenant on the New Orleans Police Force who got burned out, and, accompanied by his loyal, loving wife, Annie (Kelly Lynch), retired to the bayous, where he operates a bait shop. Dave's new, laid-back life agrees with him -- he looks good and feels great, even if he occasionally gets a craving to down a beer.
One day, Dave and Annie are out on a lake when a single-engine plane crashes into the nearby water. Dave investigates the accident site, where he rescues the sole survivor, a Spanish-speaking little girl. Through a series of rather hard-to-swallow plot contrivances, the child, named Alafair (Samantha Lagpacan), comes to live with the Robicheauxes as an unofficially adopted daughter. But Alafair has a dangerous pedigree. Suddenly, Dave and Annie are receiving some ominous visitors -- hitmen, drug lords, and DEA agents. All of them have one message: keep your nose out of our business. Of course, these warnings pique Dave's curiosity. He stops by to see Robin Gaddis (Mary Stuart Masterson), a strung-out stripper friend with knowledge and contacts, then drops in on a former schoolmate-turned-crime kingpin, Bubba Rocque (Eric Roberts), and his slutty wife, Claudette (Teri Hatcher). For Dave, the price of these visits is steep and bloody.
There's a lot going on in HEAVEN'S PRISONERS, but most of it amounts to very little. The entire background story, which involves dead Federal agents, dueling crime lords, unfaithful wives, and all sorts of unsavory dealings, becomes window dressing for Dave's vengeance. He goes after one bad guy after another, and, no matter how many he kills, there always seems to be someone else. All this leads to an ending that, after one-hundred thirty-plus minutes of watching and waiting, is a big letdown.
Although the characters are all flat stereotypes, that's no excuse for some of the bad acting. Alec Baldwin has a narrow range in which he can be effective; HEAVEN'S PRISONERS frequently makes dramatic demands upon him that he is unwilling or unable to fulfill. The result is an uninteresting, occasionally-overwrought performance. Kelly Lynch is dull as the dutiful wife. Mary Stuart Masterson, who normally is solid, fails to convince as a ""bad girl"" (much like in the movie of that title). Teri Hatcher (of TV's LOIS AND CLARK fame) plays a superficial femme fatale whose Southern accent is as on-and-off as her clothing. Only a delightful Eric Roberts and Vondie Curtis-Hall (as a DEA agent) can boast any credibility.
Presumably, HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is an attempt to elevate the revenge genre to an newer, more interesting level by including themes of redemption and responsibility. The problem is that retribution in the movies is a vicious, nasty business, and all the extraneous plot elements needlessly encumber the story. Co-writer Scott Frank, who penned MALICE (with Aaron Sorkin) and DEAD AGAIN, is known for twisty scripts, but this one loses itself in the maze. There are too many characters working with too little new material. In fact, this movie is so long-winded and repetitious that there are times when viewers of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS will feel like they're serving a sentence.

3480,"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then THE SIXTH SENSE, the surprise hit of the summer, should feel honored by STIR OF ECHOES since the stories are like fraternal twins. Both have frightening, horror picture elements and both feature a young boy who communicates with dead people.
The trouble lies in their differences.
STIR OF ECHOES, which by comparison might more aptly be titled NO SENSE, insults the viewers' intelligence at every turn. Writer and director David Koepp falls back on every cliché in the book to advance the storyline. The overly serious movie will likely have you laughing out loud at some of the film's ridiculously implausible and downright silly parts.
In contrast to Haley Joel Osment's brilliant performance as the boy in THE SIXTH SENSE, Zachary David Cope gives a loquacious but emotionless performance as Jake Witzky, a 5-year-old ""receiver."" Dead people speak and he receives, you see, not that his parents pay attention to him when he's yammering away with his companions from the spirit world.
With the top billing and the most screen time, a grizzled Kevin Bacon plays Jake's father, Tom, a blue-collar worker who lives in ""the nicest neighborhood in Chicago."" (As soon as you hear this phrase repeated, you know, of course, that the place will be filled with neighbors that will prove not quite so wonderful after all.)
After his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes Tom, he accidentally becomes a receiver too, causing him much mental anguish. Popping pills like candy, he runs around like a wild man who suffers from killer migraines. It's an embarrassingly bad, over-the-top performance for an actor as good as Bacon.
There's even the equivalent of a Receiver's Anonymous meeting to which Tom is invited. Too bad he doesn't go; it could have supplied some much-needed levity.
""Come on, what's the worst that can happen?"" Tom asks rhetorically, egging on his sister-in-law when he wants her to hypnotize him. A lot it turns out. In an attempt to gross out the audience, Tom pulls out his own front tooth, causing a small river of blood - all this because he begins to do a mind meld with the ghost who has come calling.
When Tom has sex with his wife, he has visions of another woman but a dead one. The movie's best line mixes Tom's notorious wandering eye with his current predicament. ""I'm not shocked there's another woman,"" his sister-in-law tells his wife. ""That she's dead gives one pause.""
""What exactly don't you understand?"" an agitated Tom asks his wife, who never seems to get it. For viewers the list of things they don't understand would be long. At the top of such list of conundrums might be why he would choose to fill his refrigerator completely full of nothing but dozens of large containers of orange juice?
STIR OF ECHOES desperately tries to ride on THE SIXTH SENSE's coattails. Even if it's not quite as bad as THE HAUNTING, which established the low point for this year's horror flicks, STIR OF ECHOES would be better saved for video, when you can keep your finger on the fast-forward button in order to skip the more preposterous incidents. Actually, skipping it all would be a better strategy entirely.
STIR OF ECHOES runs 1:40. It is rated R for violence, sexuality and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.

The vision presented in Larry Clark's KIDS is as bleak as things get -- an ugly portrait of amoral youths who resort to drugs and sex not as a form of rebellion, but to fill the void of otherwise empty and meaningless lives. Unfortunately, KIDS is an accurate portrayal of how certain inner city children live out their existences. Take a look at the documentary TEEN DREAMS if you doubt how dangerously close to reality this fictional presentation comes.
On the outside, Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) is the kind of clean-cut teenage boy any mother might let her daughter go out with. He looks ""normal"" -- perhaps even a little nerdy -- and can be polite and sincere when it suits him. But Telly is an inveterate liar. He will say or do anything to satisfy his addiction for deflowering virgins. Sexually uninitiated girls present the greatest challenge and, as a bonus, are guaranteed disease-free. Not that he believes in AIDS anyway -- condoms, in his opinion, are a waste of time.
Telly's best friend is Casper (Justin Pierce). While Casper also enjoys sex, his partners don't have to come with their hymens intact. And Casper's as much into drugs and drink as sleeping with girls. Like Telly, he's not concerned about the future or the consequences of his actions. He takes life as it comes, whether that means inhaling dope, raping a stoned girl, or beating someone half to death with a skateboard.
Then there's Jennie (Chloe Sevigny), who's only had sex once, but, without protection, that was enough to do irreparable damage. When her HIV test comes back positive, her life collapses around her. Nothing makes sense. Her best friend, Ruby (Rosario Dawson), has had sex with at least eight guys, yet she's clean. And when Jennie rushes to stop another girl from sharing her fate, she arrives too late.
KIDS is shot like a documentary and, in its uncompromising depiction of every aspect of the characters' social and sexual interactions, it seems almost too raw for fiction. Clark has meticulously designed this movie to blur the lines between reality and scripted story, hiring 20 year old Harmony Korine to write a screenplay that reflects what's really going on in the streets. The actors are all newcomers, and their unfamiliar faces and unpolished-yet-effective performances add to the documentary-like effect.
KIDS follows the activities of a small group of teenagers over a twenty-four hour period (a little time frame cheating, by way of flashbacks, occurs). And what a twenty-four hours it is... KIDS will likely shock some viewers, but even those expecting this kind of grueling expose will be disturbed by the casual manner in which the most heinous acts are carried out. If people lose their souls as children, what happens when they grow up? This is a tragedy without a last act -- a wrenching experience that offers no catharsis.
One of the ironies surrounding KIDS is that the MPAA wanted to slap it with an NC-17, which would have disallowed anyone under 17 from seeing it. Yet, despite the graphic nature of the material, this is the sort of thing many teenagers live with every day -- so, apparently, the message is that they can experience it outside theaters, but not view it on the screen. Miramax's decision to release the film unrated through a spinoff company at least allows the under-17 crowd an opportunity to see KIDS, if only in the company of a parent or legal guardian.
Those who call KIDS exploitative may have seen the film, but they haven't bothered to really watch it. There is not a gratuitous moment in this picture, although some of the images are so strong that viewers will wish to close their eyes or turn away. KIDS shows what transpires when children are set adrift in a heartless world, and warns us what happens -- and is already happening -- in the absence of love and guidance.

2898,"(Cinepix) Starring: Hope Davis, Anne Meara, Parker Posey, Liev Schreiber, Pat McNamara, Stanley Tucci, Campbell Scott. Screenplay: Greg Mottola. Producers: Nancy Tenenbaum and Steven Soderbergh. Director: Greg Mottola. MPAA Rating: R (profanity, adult themes) Running Time: 88 minutes. Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
There is a quality to certain independent films which I have referred to in the past as an ""oppressive quirkiness."" As frustrating as it can be to watch a Hollywood release which is a non-stop monotone of plot or action, it is similarly frustrating when a film-maker's infatuation with colorful characters at the expense of narrative results in all those colors blurring into a dull brown. Actors understandably love playing those characters, but independent writer-directors -- frequently rookie auteurs -- can't always tame their creations into a solid story. Greg Mottola's THE DAYTRIPPERS is characterized by a quirkiness more pervasive than oppressive, and some of it is quite entertaining. By the time it's all over, however, you may find yourself wondering what the point of it all was.
Hope Davis stars as Eliza D'Amico, a Long Island schoolteacher with a happy marriage to husband Louis (Stanley Tucci), a publishing house editor. At least she thinks it's a happy marriage, until she finds a love letter which appears to be to Louis from someone named Sandy. Unsure what to do, Eliza brings her concerns to her family, gathered in town for Thanksgiving: mother Rita (Anne Meara), father Jim (Pat McNamara), younger sister Jo (Parker Posey) and Jo's boyfriend Carl (Liev Schreiber). They suggest that Eliza needs to investigate her suspicions, and accompany her into New York City for a Friday-after-Thanksgiving day of sleuthing. As it turns out, they may find out more about each other than about Louis's fidelity.
For well over half of THE DAYTRIPPERS, the character riffs provide a lot of laughs without becoming repetitive or abrasive. Liev Schreiber has the most subtly amusing role, an intellectual would-be author who bashes middle class obliviousness even as he sucks up to the obliviously middle class Rita. His rather pompous diatribes are played straight and in a low key, making his later humbling at the hands of a rival author (Campbell Scott) as sad as it is funny. Anne Meara and Pat McNamara play the bickering parents with interesting shadings on stereotypical characterizations, and Parker Posey again shows off her indie-queen charm. Mottola puts them in a variety of bizarre situations, including what Posey aptly describes as ""the shortest car chase in history,"" and peppers the film with memorable minor roles like Marcia Gay Harden's turn as a drunken party-goer trying to deal with the presence of an ex-boyfriend at the party. At the sane center sits Hope Davis's Eliza, a woman trying to maintain her dignity under stressful conditions -- if worrying about your husband having a mistress were not bad enough, _you_ try to deal with it while trapped in a car with your parents.
As the story plays out, Eliza's positioning in that sane center proves to be one of THE DAYTRIPPERS' most glaring problems. Ultimately, this story is about how Eliza comes to be in the situation of chasing around her possibly-philandering husband, but mostly we watch Eliza reacting to the people around her. It may be part of Mottola's vision for Eliza that she is too passive, yet the result is that we don't understand enough about who Eliza is or how she feels about her life. We see that Rita has manipulated her daughters' relationships in a thinly disguised disdain for their value as individuals, and that should guide us to an awakening in Eliza. Instead, we get an abrupt emotional response and an even more abrupt conclusion to the film, hard on the heels of a revelation which feels more self-consciously clever than appropriate for the rest of the film.
On an even more fundamental level, THE DAYTRIPPERS loses its audience because it loses its sense of humor. After sixty minutes worth of appealing wit, Mottola perhaps falls victim to a concern that his film will be considered too frivolous. Thus follows a series of shouting matches, confrontations and Big Dramatic Moments which ends up melding two acts of George Bernard Shaw to one act of Tennessee Williams. THE DAYTRIPPERS has a lot of good-natured humor to recommend it, but I'm not sure Greg Mottola really knew what he wanted to do with the lively characters he had created. He may have learned one lesson of independent film-making the hard way: it's a good start to put a bunch of interesting characters together in a vehicle and set them on their way, but sooner or later that vehicle has to come to a destination. THE DAYTRIPPERS is an entertaining ride while that vehicle is in motion. Mottola just needs to learn how to park as smoothly as he drives.

3318,"DOG PARK, a movie by first-time writer and director Bruce McCulloch, concerns a group of singles who meet in dog parks, where single dogs and humans get to mingle with other singles. The only rule is that the owners reveal their dogs' names but never their own. Too bad the actors, in this imitation of a bad sitcom pilot, couldn't get their names removed from the credits. The dogs, who only drool and smile, deliver more lively and interesting performances.
In Heaven the characters in this movie must have missed the table where they passed out personalities. They are all vapid. In the few, the very few, times the movie approaches even mildly cute, the director kills the moment, almost as if he were trying to keep the movie from being funny. Although marketed as a romantic comedy, in truth the movie belongs to a genre that might be called laughless non-romances. The studio did not screen the film in advance to critics in the hope, one suspects, that some people would see it before the word got out as to how bad it was.
As in a daytime soap opera, the characters are captured in periodic shifts of their musical beds. A used to sleep with B but has now switched to C, who used to live with D, etc. You get the idea. In fact, you could probably write a better script from this premise than McCulloch did.
Andy (Luke Wilson), who is depressed because he's just broken up with his girlfriend, is given a cassette by his friend Jeff (McCulloch, the director). It contains ""the saddest songs in the Western World,"" Jeff tells him. ""What you need is country and western music."" Once Andy can listen to it without crying, Jeff claims that he will be over the break-up.
Typical of the stilted dialog is a scene in a bar in which Andy meets his new girlfriend, Lorna (Natasha Henstridge), who plays Miss Bookworm in a kids' TV series. When the lonely Lorna changes her drink order to a double, the bartender grimaces and says ""ouch!""
""What do you do?"" Lorna asks Andy when he comes over to strike up a conversation with her. ""I work writing classifieds,"" he replies with his signature earnestness, as if his every answer had some hidden sad portent. ""I've read your work -- some of it's pretty good,"" she says. The scene, which is one of those with a modicum of promise, is killed by the dull tone that the director sets. Another scene with unrealized potential has a dog psychiatrist advising the dog's owners, who are no longer a couple, not to have wild sex in their respective houses since it traumatizes the pooch.
When the two lovebirds, Andy and Lorna, go home to kiss, they look like a couple of adults trying to make fish mouths to entertain small children. Surely these actors have kissed someone before. If not, they should have practiced in advance.
As lifestyle editor Jeri, Jeff's current squeeze, Janeane Garofalo isn't able to do anything with her part. Maybe the movie's material was hopeless from the outset.
I have spared the rest of the large cast from embarrassment by not mentioning their names. A sleep-inducing film, DOG PARK simply has nothing to recommend it. It should have gone direct to video so that the lower price would make viewers feel slightly less cheated.
DOG PARK runs 1:31. It is rated R for sexuality and language and would be acceptable for teenagers.

4820,"So men, what could you do if you could read women's minds? And women, wouldn't it be wonderful if your guy knew what you really wanted rather than what he incorrectly thought you wanted? (And what if your man were Mel Gibson?)
In WHAT WOMEN WANT, director Nancy Meyers, working from a stellar script by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, creates the perfect Christmas gift for holiday viewers. As a comedy, it is side-splittingly funny with laughs so big that you'll have to see it again to hear all of the lines. As a love story, it is infectiously romantic, with great songs (""I've Got You Under My Skin"") and some old-fashioned ""making out"" with wonderful kissing. And as a touching drama, it has tender, poignant moments that are completely honest. Wrapped by cinematographer Dean Cundey with lush colors, the gift is so carefully conceived and executed that we almost feel compelled to send Paramount Pictures a Thank You card.
As the story opens, we meet playboy Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson), a man's man who has no problem embarrassing his female office staff with lewd jokes. He is Mr. Suave, and, after years of being ""the king of the T&A ads,"" for the advertising agency in which he works, Mr. Ultra Confidence is about to be promoted to Creative Director.
Or he was, until the agency's head, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda), decided that they needed a woman to better understand the female market. Dan hires Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), whom Nick believes to be ""a bitch on wheels"" and a ""man-eater,"" in other words, his opposite.
Given a homework assignment by Darcy, Nick applies nail polish, performs hot wax exfoliation and tries on pantyhose in order to understand what women think about the products that they use. With sweetly humorous displays of physical comedy in this cross-dressing scene, Gibson reels in any audience members not yet under his spell. Our audience went wild during this sequence, which turned out to be but one of many amazing scenes.
One memorable moment occurs when Nick, alone in his Chicago penthouse, begins to lip-synch while doing a Fred Astaire-style dance number, complete with black hat. Gibson is nothing short of incredible in his part.
A shock to Nick's system gives him the ability to read women's minds. At first, this scares the daylights out of him. He learns, for example, not to go near a cosmetics counter of a department store, lest the cacophony of sounds come close to exploding his brain. It's frightening to hear the mental put-downs of his co-workers. He becomes so gun-shy and fearful that he seems to be hyperventilating. His ""gift"" for eavesdropping becomes a near death experience for him.
Nick's old analyst, Dr. Perkins (Bette Midler), first recognizes the possibilities of his new powers. ""If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, you speak Venusian,"" she tells him. This, she concludes, means that ""You can rule.""
Sure enough, rule is exactly what he does. But he becomes somewhat of a benevolent ruler, who sees what he can do for everyone from his estranged 15-year-old daughter to the suicidal nerd, a self-described ""geek in the glasses,"" who is a poorly treated messenger in his office. Mainly, however, he believes that he can use his newfound abilities to steal Darcy's job, which he thinks rightly belongs to him. With a she's-going-down attitude, he runs circles around her by expropriating her ideas after she thinks them. Of course, along the way, they fall in love, complicating his plans. Hunt's performance, while not quite at Gibson's level, is extremely likeable. The great chemistry between them is one of the show's many delights.
Nick's mind-reading abilities make him a lover straight out of Cosmopolitan. He knows exactly what women want in bed. Lola (Marisa Tomei), the sex-starved coffee store worker who finally agrees to date him, calls him ""a sex god"" after their ""life-altering sex.""
As Mr. Personality, every woman in the office starts coming to Nick for advice. Gibson turns the charm on the audience as well. With or without the ability to read women's minds, I predict that most women will leave the theater totally in love with Gibson after this performance. To be fair, many already are.
Comedies aren't normally good at character development. Romantic comedies are better but they usually only flesh out the two leads. Since the writers in WHAT WOMEN WANT are able to have every minor characters share their innermost thoughts with us, we get to know and care about characters who have only minuscule screen time. One of the best of many small subplots concerns the aforementioned messenger. We sympathize with her plight, even if she has only a few lines. The writers milk them for the emotional equivalent of heavy cream.
The film goes down as smoothly as a glass of Christmas eggnog. The only complaint possible is that it is such a heart-warming story that you don't want it to stop. But stop it does with an ending as satisfying as the rest of the picture. This is a movie in which it's easy to fall in love.
WHAT WOMEN WANT runs 2:06 but feels a half-hour shorter. It is rated PG-13 for sexual content and language and would be fine for teenagers.
