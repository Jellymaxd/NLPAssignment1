"If you are looking for a very active multiplayer soccer game then this is an excellent choice. With thousands of players holding friendly or tournament matches, you'll always find a worthy opponent.

Controlling the players of your team is not that complicated, on the contrary, everything you need is nicely packaged in some kind of basic controls and that is very beneficial if you are new to the game.

The commentators are always very active in sharing the appropriate comments or criticism, alternating from humor to minor frustration, these voice actors seem to come straight from a real football match.

The graphics are also quite breathtaking, with an eye for detail on just about everything, the billboards, the realistic appearance of the players' faces, the accuracy in existing arenas.

Here you can see an online match of Belgium vs Napoli"
"Basically an eFootball PES 2020 with different rosters, no AC Milan and Inter Milan, same one sided referee, same graphics, possibly less upcoming Legends, same sluggish, pace literally still doesn't matter, but with more ""almost"" OP opponents, literally almost make no foul and keep spamming turn and shoot technique where they'd have 90% chance to score and our defenders become statue, more scripts or what they so called ""Realistic & Momentum""...., more bugs, and so on, and so forth......love it.....

On the other hand, it has better gameplay, more responsive controls (than 2020), more fancy theme colour, less awkward collision.....this is should've been what pes 2020 suppose to be.....like....seriously......

If you haven't own PES 2020 yet, this one might be for you.

P.S.:
1. Review written in day one patch state, so things may or may not gonna change after the next Data Pack (as usual). Hopefully they won't butchered the gameplay again.
2. Didn't check the online stuffs, as I don't even bother with it. I'd assume it'll still exactly the same contents and same issues that they don't even bother to fix and also coins dependencies."
"Clearly an improvement from PES 2020. In this version (PES 2021) you don't get frustrated, players respond much better and they don't act as idiots (as they frequently did in PES 2020). Offline gameplay (passing and specially the pace of the game) is better now. Online content is practically the same as last year. If you can find it for 20 euros or less, it would be a nice price. Other things for example modes like Master League or menus are the same as PES 2020, because this is a Season Update; so if you only want updated teams and transfers; don't buy it (use an option file for PES 2020, if you really liked last year's gameplay...). As I said, the gameplay changes are good (still needs a few more tweaks but this year the game is playable and enjoyable).
If you want more offline content you can always use sider (i recommend it a lot), which is a nice modding tool for adding stadiums, kits, faces, scoreboards... and makes the game more realistic in this way."
"There is a lot of things wrong or annoying in the game both on and off the pitch. And I'm not just talking licenses here. And most of these things have been a non-fixed issue for PES for years now.

AI players repeatedly ignore the ball instead of running to it
makes passing feel static and cluttered situations extremely frustrating
Very bad commentators (both German and English) repeat themselves and misinterpret situations all the time
One sec freeze frame after every replay (both skipped and non-skipped)
Team selection is cluttered with a lot of  teams
AI opponents balancing is off
Replays still start a good 2 seconds too early making just wanting to rewatch a good shot very tedious
Game modes and presentation still need improvements
And a lot more

In the end, unless you're desperate for a football game and don't like FIFA either, I can't see myself recommending this game to anyone. If you just want to have fun with friends, I'd say the demo is enough for a few hours. The full game won't offer you much more than that."
"Worst online experience I ever had in my life. It's 2020. How can multiplayer matchmaking be, not bad, but awful? And when you do finally get an opponent after 10 minutes of waiting, in the 20th minute of the match which was going great network and ping-based, you get a message that the match has unexpectedly ended for unknown reason. Thank god I got the game for 10 bucks, because I am not sure that it is worth it even that much.
 "
"Don't get me wrong, this is by far on-field the best football game ever but overall experience of playing it is a just 'meh' game..

If you opted for just a casual play without even connecting to your 500mbps Internet speed, then this is the game for you.

If you opted more on online gaming experience, even though both PES and Fifa offered astonishingly bad experience, go for Fifa as the online experience is more better and it is much more easier to be connected to other players"
"Same slow stupid gameplay like the last year. You can't keep the ball, tackling players are always in advantage. Passing is veeeeery slow, advance controls are unfair versus automatic through ball... Online ""TryHard"" players always use scripted tactics for certain goals. There's no variety of situation and most of the goals are made with the same playstyle. Series of instant passing and automatic trough ball to the attacking players. Most of them are playing with the same soccer teams/players and that isn't helping to break the monotony, boredom and frustration.

Konami make PES fun to play again, like in the old days! I will play it, only because there is no other decent football game. Not because it is good! MAKE GAMEPLAY RESPONSIVE PLEESE!"
"Pros:
Decent graphics and gameplay
Faces for a lot of players are accurate

Cons:
Online
Online matchmaking might take 5 minutes and more
Refs are horrible
Free kicks are goals with 90% probability
Long range shots are goals way too often
Offline
Menus are stuck in 2000s
BAL mode is boring, no immersion, just forward to next match and that's it
Commentary is very bad
Stadium/crowd atmosphere is weak"
"Been a PES fan for decades, but it's getting harder and harder to stay loyal.

The AI seems to get dumber with every iteration. Thankfully this is the last one on the Fox Engine, which has been a dreadful engine for PES.

Pros: Great player likenesses. Great lighting and shadow effects. Dribbling is very good (although ruined by dumb AI moving out your way). Full Manual controls in enjoyable.

Cons. Very stupid AI who constantly move out of your way instead of trying to tackle you. CPU controlled teammates unaware the ball is right in front of them, so they don't take possession of it and the game doesn't change you into that player, forcing your to give up possession. Player switching is terribly inconsistent. Presentation and commentary is stuck in 2010. Midfield is not required, the game is simply about who can score the most, ignoring the fact in real football you can defend well and steal the win with a single goal. Referees are completely useless, blatant fouls are let go, whilst clean tackles are punished.

Ultimately, i play this game simply for my love of football, but i don't recommend it. And wouldn't even call it enjoyable. The AI is far too dumb, the game leans far too much towards attacking, rendering the midfield pointless and the defence an afterthought. The frustrations far outweigh the enjoyable parts.

PES used to be a tactical battle, in terms of formations, tactics and lineups along with midfield battles and decision making like when to press, when to sit, when to push forward. Now its just a sprint and shoot game, like FIFA.

Thankfully, the Fox engine is dead and Konami are moving to Unreal. Hopefully they can recapture what PES used to be. Because the last few games have been abysmal and un-enjoyable."
"I simply do not enjoy the game-play this year. I really liked pes 2018 and 2019. I didn't play 2020 so I thought I'd pick up this one again since it was less than half of the normal price with the sale.

CONS:
-The movement and everything the players do is so clunky compared to how it used to be.
-Professional world class players somehow can't take a good first touch
-No one can run with the ball. I you even sprint for a second you get shoved off the ball
-The interceptions are so unpredictable (The ""derp mode"" when everyone is fumbling for the ball is far worse than ever.)
-Free kicks are WAY TOO EASY TO SCORE. If you foul anywhere within 35YDs it's almost a guaranteed goal.
-Strength is OP. Pick tall, high strength players and be prepared to win every single tackle easily.
-There are game-breaking exploits like being able to BLOCK THE GK IN CO-OP on free kicks.
-You still can't add filters to matchmaking i.e. Co-op against other co-op teams, not a player with AI team mates. Or play against others using manual controls only. Also you can't just play against real teams. It's always against myClub teams.
-The friends list system and match room stuff is soooo bad. No integration for steam friends list or anything. Want to play co-op? Ok go browse servers and do all this other bs. Just a huge lack of online features. Want to play a random selection match with a friend online? Too bad, local matches only.
-They give way too much away on myClub. Very few players should have a full black ball team the first week of release if any at all. They make it too easy to get the best players. Why is it that EVERY OPPONENT HAS ALL THE ICONS AND FULL BLACK BALL BENCH?? It would be better to be forced to play with an ok team that is 3-star rated maybe a gold or two. Nope, it's white ball team then straight to black ball right away. This makes it so unrewarding.
-Player switching mechanics are worse. Like the ball will move through a player right by the ball and it won't let you switch. Changing to manual or whatever did not help.
-Every player online just pings it up top and 1-2 passes thru ball and that's it. That's because it is the only style in this version that gets rewarded.
-You can score off kickoff by sending your passer on a run after kickoff then just long thru and it works 50% of the time because of horrible marking AI on def.
-Still uses peer-to-peer connection, no dedicated matchmaking servers which leads to connection and lag.
-Huge amount of cheaters in the game. I come up against myClub teams with the ENTIRE TEAM RATED 109 which is impossible. It would come out to 99 in every stat and there is a training level limit that prevents this so WTF.
-Nothing else other than what is mentioned above has changed from the older versions. So essentially the gameplay has gone way downhill. Graphics, data packs, and whatnot is pretty much the same as it has been."
"Here's the thing, I do love the game mechanics. On the pitch, this game is fantastic. With manual passing and manual shooting, the game improves even more. It just feels right.

However, the game modes are rigged when you play against the AI. In Master League or when playing Leagues or other story-like modes, the game feels scripted. Games versus your ""rivals"" are much tougher. You might even get two early goals and ""somehow"" manage to turn the game in the last minutes. This similar fishy moments happen way too often.

If you want to play Master League or other story modes, I cant recommend this title. But if you are here to enjoy a few games against the computer or have a few friends over to play against each other, then this is the right game. Fantastic football game tainted with terrible scripted A.I. in story modes and leagues vs the computer."

POSTED: 16 OCTOBER
Best PES since 2016 by far imo

BAD THINGS
- Referees are too biased & they grant a foul for the AI at every given chance, even at a slightest touch
- Outcomes of 1v1 duels are often unrealistic, a literal dwarf could body & overpower a mountain if the game wants so
- Matchmaking is horrible

GOOD THINGS
- Dribbling is not too OP or unrealistic, it is perfectly balanced as all things should be
- Keepers actually make saves & dive instead of standing
- AI have legit tactics instead of attacking mindlessly
- Great graphics"
"I am coming from FIFA, however i stopped supporting EA as of FIFA 19 as they are just a terrible company and offer a squad update and expect full price. They have scripted games and poor networks... anyways, back to PES21.

It is also bad. Extremely slow, no online players, unrealistic game-play, poor controls.

Gameplay goes to fifa.

pes21 has good visuals but that is where it ends.

I tried PES21, but unfortunately it is just poor... I suppose I'll try fifa 21 on steam this year."
"
I strongly do not recommend this game for online experience. If you want to play locally with friends maybe it the best football game you can get. If you want to play single player it is bound to get repetitive eventually.

Positive:
The best football simulation game in the market.
Offline is decent but gets repetitive real fast once you beat the higher difficulty AI
Negative:
The online aspect is really abysmal, scummy and cheating by the developer.
1) Hard to find games
2) When you find games, there are random disconnections
3) When the connection is good, the matches are scripted and the result is predetermined by the game
Although the players have form, it is overridden by scripting and you can tell the other team is boosted in stats and outcome will be a loss.

Atleast in olden days there is a toggle if you want turn on catch up mechanism. But now this is outright scam when they sell you highly skilled players for money and even when they are in form, they perform poorly when the game decides. It's is equivalent to cheating or scamming the customers."
"This time I figured I'd try out PES and see if it improved on any of things I find FIFA games are lacking in. Turns out in my experience so far PES 2021 is worse in almost every way.

So comparing PES to FIFA
Pros: Gameplay
Cons: Everything else"
"full of scripts bad mechanics, defenders cant control the ball and the whole game feels way to slow, you have to wait a second or two in order to pass the ball after the control and Im not gonna discuss the long through ball this year."
"This year, PES will drop the idea of a new edition for PES 2021 and will go with the way of season update. PES 2021 will be an updated version of PES 2020 with the latest player information and updated squads. This decision allows them to concentrate better on their edition for the next-gen consoles. The next-gen game will be developed by Unreal Engine 5 and bring drastic improvements to the overall game.

any way PES has outstanding gameplay built over many years of refinement, so if you love football you will love PES."
"im a fifa player ....but this year. they are same decision... only minor update (fifa 21 beta nothings change...just like fifa 20) becuase of that ..this time i choose pes 2021.......and server is good enough and stable connection .... minor immprovment from pes 2020 but its good and you feel it,,.......if you are fifa player , this time you should change your mind (better graphic/better gameplay) and pay it half of the price of fifa 21"
"Pluses: Satisfying gameplay, Master League is pretty fun, licenses aren't an issue since it's very easy to just install Option File fixing the fake teams. MyClub is fun as card-collecting mode. Game runs smoothly during gameplay* in 60FPS on a far from top PC (i-3 4160, R9 270, 8GB RAM DDR3) on medium settings. (Drops to 50-55 on high)

*excluding cutscenes/celebration close-ups, it's not a big issue since you don't control anything at those moments

Minuses: Online. Haven't found a match earlier than 10 minutes in yet. Connection tends to worsen A LOT during the match itself (and no, it's not an issue with my internet). MyClub has way less functions than FUT; and there aren't any special modes offline - player career, manager career, quickplay, that's about it.

$25 vs $70 is a good argument though



Summary: if you want to hop in once in a while, play a few games, maybe lead a club for a few seasons, make a nice squad in online card-collecting mode without the need for spending hundreds of bucks - take PES.

If you just want to grind/spend some money instead in an online mode, or have a wider choice of gamemodes - think you'd be better off getting FIFA."
"So this is a ""Season Update"" since PES devs are busy making PES 2022 with Unreal Engine 5, which means this game is almost the same with PES 2020.
However, there are a couple of differences, and to be honest, they're not nice changes at all.

Unfortunately, the game has been dumbed down big time.
-Goalkeepers are almost useless, any player can score outside from the box like they're freakin' Batistuta, right in the corner. And top players like van Basten or Rummenigge can even score while they're under huge pressure.
-Also the passing system is a mess. Even while you are facing away from your teammate, you are able to pass the ball with almost 100% accuracy.
The online script can still break these obviously but you know the script interferes and affects many dynamics in the game and it's just another evil.

Anyway, gameplay-wise, these are the two biggest differences I've experienced so far compared to PES 2020.
For the rest, you can read my review about PES 2020 here as they still apply to this day(except the super-cancel bug).

But since the game is cheaper, I'll give a thumb up only to support Konami for the sake of PES 2022, so I hope our support this year isn't for nothing and PES 2022 can rival FIFA in all aspects and not just gameplay.

Edit: Actually, I changed my mind. And I'm changing my review to negative cuz it is aids.
-Defending in a football game by pressing 2 buttons shouldn't be praised. It is so bad that if you wanna defend manually it punishes you. It feels like there is no skill gap between players, maybe except top 1%, but for the rest, for 3 consecutive years now it's like I'm playing against the same guy. It is disgusting.
-Also, a football game with a dead dribbling system shouldn't be praised.
-And a game mode (matchday) which forces you to play against someone who's literally 11000 kilometers away shouldn't be praised as well.

This is a garbage game, stay away from it, at least from the online modes if you little care about your mental health."
"This is a good football game. The game feels more natural and free-flowing than FIFA in that nothing feels scripted. Like if you shoot a rocket it could deflect off the keeper and into the net based on game physics while in FIFA it is a scripted save.

But what separates it from being a good game to a great game is the foul system. it really needs fixing. I am yet to get a penalty kick awarded from blatant fouls ( One frustrating example is how my Salah was pushed in the penalty box but ref did not call it.) Worse, the AI ref punishes you heavily. You will be penalized for legal challenges so you are forced to be too cautious. I've conceded goals based on fears that my challenge might lead to a free kick (which the AI will very likely score if just outside the box) or PK. The developers really need to fix this.
 "
"
As I playing more and more with the game I can confirm that its still garbage.
They said its the same game as 2020 which is ok , but they did not even fixed anything and resold the same again with some player changes which you can mod by yourself.
Scripted ai can score against you whenever they want .Your goal keeper is , theirs are defending almost everything .( leads to your 20 shot / 1 goal , their 4 shot / 3 goal )
Players are completely dumbs , standing on the pitch without moving for a better position or always goes to offside when attacking . They are not even trying to get the ball when its just come closer to them because THEY ARE NOT THE INITIAL RECEIVERS OF THE BALL .
Referee will still whistle 95% of time when you just normally tackle or get the ball from the enemy while the ai will pull you back , jostle you and nothing happens.
Oh , and Online is completely unplayable by lags and cheating.
I would refund anytime this game but I can't since I bought it from elsewhere.
Fifa 21 will be the same as 18 but Konami should stop making sport games."
"I absolutely love the game and I believe that new players, or those who haven't played pes 2020 will enjoy this game. Very realistic, and rewarding.The game runs absolutely well on my old hp elite 8200 i5 with 4Gb Ram & 2Gb Gt 1030 card."
"Here's an honest review after an hour and 20 minutes of gameplay. For those people looking to buy this game because of huge improvements in gameplay and other new features, you are going to be dissappointed. This as most of you may be aware is just a season update, hence no significant gameplay changes. So why should I upgrade from Pes 2020, you may ask? Well if you are looking to play online, then it is must. There are also tiny gameplay changes such as minor tweaks to passing and dribbling which make it bit more bearable. Another thing is the pitches have finally been realistically designed as opposed to the arcady pitches in 2020. The passing is totally realistic and feels more crisper this year compared to last year. The UI has been slightly more polished. For those who are solely interested in offline modes such as Master League, you will be dissappointed as they are largely the same as 2020.One con i can think of is the dribbling where players often run into each other instead of avoiding or going around them.; or when a slow ass player manages to outrun speedy players., This is one of the areas which MUST be addressed in PES 2022. Another issue is the shooting mechanic, specially the finesse/curling shots which still feel like slow motion. This is one area where PES can massively improve over FIFA. Finally the pricing of the game at £24.99/ $30 may feel like a bit much for just a season update. Personally I would have priced this around $5 dollar less but its not like FIFA every year where they make miniscule changes and charge a premium price.To sum up , Pros-1. Best Football Simulator in 2020.2. Passing is the best ever designed in a football game3. The customizations such as adding stadiums, teams and leagues as well as other stuff like scoreboards, adboards, chants etc.Cons- 1. Dribbling needs to be improved significantly.2. Shooting feels the same as 2020, like the slow motion curling shots3. Price of $30 may be a bit much for just minor changesOverall Rating - 7.5/10"
"Since the first game I have noticed a big difference in the gameplay -the player moments and responsive is way superior , they has dramatically improve the player movement is not that I need hours to notice that, is a superior change , i really hated that pes 20 feels so clunky but this pes movement and responsiveness is way superior , it's worthy of the investment for sure. i dont play that game of my club I just care about the gameplay and the online - and in those department is a home run.ball phyisiques are betterTHE MOST IMPORTANT PART it feels way better in the dribbling department , better movement better reactions to the controls"
