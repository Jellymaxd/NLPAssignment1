In Great Britain August 3, 1945 8 Claims. (c1. 170-1354) s This invention has reference to jet propulsion units for mounting on either the sustaining blades or the sustaining and propulsive blades of helicopters.

The blades may either be telescopic or they may be permanently rigid.

The primary object of the invention is the provision of propulsion units which enable the objectionable gyroscopic reaction which takes place during rotation of the units around the axis of the sustaining or sustaining and propulsive rotor to be largerly avoided.

According to one feature of the invention a jet propulsion unit having anair compressor driven by the outflowing combustion gases by means of a turbine, is provided between the compressor and turbine with direction-reversing mechanism of any suitable construction, whereby the compressor and turbine will rotate in opposite directions when the engine is in operation.

According to an alternative feature the axes of the turbine and compressor are arranged parallel to or coincident with the-longitudinal axes of the blades, the air intake and the delivery passage for the burnt gases being fitted with elbows so that these passages are directed substantially perpendicularly to the axis of the blades.

Further features of the invention comprise rotating blades as above defined in combination with a propulsion unit as set forth above. The axis of the engine may either be coincident with or parallel to but slightly offset with respect to the longitudinal axis of the blade to which the engine is allocated. The blade will be ofiset to provide for the case when the gyroscopic reactions of the oppositely rotating turbine and compressor cannot be exactly balanced the offsetting being above or below the said longitudinal axis, the position depending on the direction of rotation of whichever of the said two rotating elements is the heavier with respect to the direction of rotation of the blade.

The present invention is applicable to the machine set forth in either or both of the specifications of my patent applications Serial No. 688,- 269, filed August 3, 1946 and Serial No. 688,270, filed August 3, 1946, and is shown in greater detail diagrammatically on the accompanying drawings in which,

This application is a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. § 371(c) of prior-filed, co-pending, PCT application serial number PCT/US2013/066392, filed on Oct. 23, 2013, which claims priority to Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/717,445 filed Oct. 23, 2012 and titled “PROPULSION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE”, and is related to PCT application serial number PCT/US2013/066383, titled “UNDUCTED THRUST PRODUCING SYSTEM” filed on Oct. 23, 2013, and PCT application serial number PCT/US2013/066403, titled “VANE ASSEMBLY FOR AN UNDUCTED THRUST PRODUCING SYSTEM” filed on Oct. 23, 2013. All of the above listed applications are herein incorporated by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The technology described herein relates to an unducted thrust producing system, particularly architectures for such systems. The technology is of particular benefit when applied to “open rotor” gas turbine engines.

Gas turbine engines employing an open rotor design architecture are known. A turbofan engine operates on the principle that a central gas turbine core drives a bypass fan, the fan being located at a radial location between a nacelle of the engine and the engine core. An open rotor engine instead operates on the principle of having the bypass fan located outside of the engine nacelle. This permits the use of larger fan blades able to act upon a larger volume of air than for a turbofan engine, and thereby improves propulsive efficiency over conventional engine designs.

Optimum performance has been found with an open rotor design having a fan provided by two contra-rotating rotor assemblies, each rotor assembly carrying an array of airfoil blades located outside the engine nacelle. As used herein, “contra-rotational relationship” means that the blades of the first and second rotor assemblies are arranged to rotate in opposing directions to each other. Typically the blades of the first and second rotor assemblies are arranged to rotate about a common axis in opposing directions, and are axially spaced apart along that axis. For example, the respective blades of the first rotor assembly and second rotor assembly may be co-axially mounted and spaced apart, with the blades of the first rotor assembly configured to rotate clockwise about the axis and the blades of the second rotor assembly configured to rotate counter-clockwise about the axis (or vice versa). In appearance, the fan blades of an open rotor engine resemble the propeller blades of a conventional turboprop engine.

The use of contra-rotating rotor assemblies provides technical challenges in transmitting power from the power turbine to drive the blades of the respective two rotor assemblies in opposing directions.

It would be desirable to provide an open rotor propulsion system utilizing a single rotating propeller assembly analogous to a traditional bypass fan which reduces the complexity of the design, yet yields a level of propulsive efficiency comparable to contra-rotating propulsion designs with a significant weight and length reduction.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
An unducted thrust producing system has a rotating element with an axis of rotation and a stationary element. The rotating element includes a plurality of blades, and the stationary element has a plurality of vanes configured to impart a change in tangential velocity of the working fluid opposite to that imparted by the rotating element acted upon by the rotating element. The system includes an inlet forward of the rotating element and the stationary element.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
In all of the Figures which follow, like reference numerals are utilized to refer to like elements throughout the various embodiments depicted in the Figures.

FIG. 1 shows an elevational cross-sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of an unducted thrust producing system 10. As is seen from FIG. 1, the unducted thrust producing system 10 takes the form of an open rotor propulsion system and has a rotating element 20 depicted as a propeller assembly which includes an array of airfoil blades 21 around a central longitudinal axis 11 of the unducted thrust producing system 10. Blades 21 are arranged in typically equally spaced relation around the centreline 11, and each blade 21 has a root 23 and a tip 24 and a span defined therebetween. Unducted thrust producing system 10 includes a gas turbine engine having a gas generator 40 and a low pressure turbine 50. Left- or right-handed engine configurations can be achieved by mirroring the airfoils of 21, 31, and 50. As an alternative, an optional reversing gearbox 55 (located in or behind the low pressure turbine 50 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 or combined or associated with power gearbox 60 as shown in FIG. 3) permits a common gas generator and low pressure turbine to be used to rotate the fan blades either clockwise or counterclockwise, i.e., to provide either left- or right-handed configurations, as desired, such as to provide a pair of oppositely-rotating engine assemblies as may be desired for certain aircraft installations. Unducted thrust producing system 10 in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 also includes an integral drive (power gearbox) 60 which may include a gearset for decreasing the rotational speed of the propeller assembly relative to the low pressure turbine 50.

Unducted thrust producing system 10 also includes in the exemplary embodiment a non-rotating stationary element 30 which includes an array of vanes 31 also disposed around central axis 11, and each blade 31 has a root 33 and a tip 34 and a span defined therebetween. These vanes may be arranged such that they are not all equidistant from the rotating assembly, and may optionally include an annular shroud or duct 100 distally from axis 11 (as shown in FIG. 2) or may be unshrouded. These vanes are mounted to a stationary frame and do not rotate relative to the central axis 11, but may include a mechanism for adjusting their orientation relative to their axis 90 and/or relative to the blades 21. For reference purposes, FIG. 1 also depicts a Forward direction denoted with arrow F, which in turn defines the forward and aft portions of the system. As shown in FIG. 1, the rotating element 20 is located forward of the gas generator 40 in a “puller” configuration, and the exhaust 80 is located aft of the stationary element 30.

In addition to the noise reduction benefit, the duct 100 shown in FIG. 2 provides a benefit for vibratory response and structural integrity of the stationary vanes 31 by coupling them into an assembly forming an annular ring or one or more circumferential sectors, i.e., segments forming portions of an annular ring linking two or more vanes 31 such as pairs forming doublets. The duct 100 may allow the pitch of the vanes to be varied as desired.

A significant, perhaps even dominant, portion of the noise generated by the disclosed fan concept is associated with the interaction between wakes and turbulent flow generated by the upstream blade-row and its acceleration and impingement on the downstream blade-row surfaces. By introducing a partial duct acting as a shroud over the stationary vanes, the noise generated at the vane surface can be shielded to effectively create a shadow zone in the far field thereby reducing overall annoyance. As the duct is increased in axial length, the efficiency of acoustic radiation through the duct is further affected by the phenomenon of acoustic cut-off, which can be employed, as it is for conventional aircraft engines, to limit the sound radiating into the far-field. Furthermore, the introduction of the shroud allows for the opportunity to integrate acoustic treatment as it is currently done for conventional aircraft engines to attenuate sound as it reflects or otherwise interacts with the liner. By introducing acoustically treated surfaces on both the interior side of the shroud and the hub surfaces upstream and downstream of the stationary vanes, multiple reflections of acoustic waves emanating from the stationary vanes can be substantially attenuated.

In operation, the rotating blades 21 are driven by the low pressure turbine via gearbox 60 such that they rotate around the axis 11 and generate thrust to propel the unducted thrust producing system 10, and hence an aircraft to which it is associated, in the forward direction F.

It may be desirable that either or both of the sets of blades 21 and 31 incorporate a pitch change mechanism such that the blades can be rotated with respect to an axis of pitch rotation either independently or in conjunction with one another. Such pitch change can be utilized to vary thrust and/or swirl effects under various operating conditions, including to provide a thrust reversing feature which may be useful in certain operating conditions such as upon landing an aircraft.

Blades 31 are sized, shaped, and configured to impart a counteracting swirl to the fluid so that in a downstream direction aft of both rows of blades the fluid has a greatly reduced degree of swirl, which translates to an increased level of induced efficiency. Blades 31 may have a shorter span than blades 21, as shown in FIG. 1, for example, 50% of the span of blades 21, or may have longer span or the same span as blades 21 as desired. Vanes 31 may be attached to an aircraft structure associated with the propulsion system, as shown in FIG. 1, or another aircraft structure such as a wing, pylon, or fuselage. Vanes 31 of the stationary element may be fewer or greater in number than, or the same in number as, the number of blades 21 of the rotating element and typically greater than two, or greater than four, in number.

In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, an annular 360 degree inlet 70 is located between the fan blade assembly 20 and the fixed or stationary blade assembly 30, and provides a path for incoming atmospheric air to enter the gas generator 40 radially inwardly of the stationary element 30. Such a location may be advantageous for a variety of reasons, including management of icing performance as well as protecting the inlet 70 from various objects and materials as may be encountered in operation.

FIG. 5 illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a gas turbine engine 10, differing from the embodiment of FIG. 1 in the location of the inlet 71 forward of both the rotating element 20 and the stationary element 30 and radially inwardly of the rotating element 20.

FIGS. 1 and 5 both illustrate what may be termed a “puller” configuration where the thrust-generating rotating element 20 is located forward of the gas generator 40. FIG. 6 on the other hand illustrates what may be termed a “pusher” configuration embodiment where the gas generator 40 is located forward of the rotating element 20. As with the embodiment of FIG. 5, the inlet 71 is located forward of both the rotating element 20 and the stationary element 30 and radially inwardly of the rotating element 20. The exhaust 80 is located inwardly of and aft of both the rotating element 20 and the stationary element 30. The system depicted in FIG. 6 also illustrates a configuration in which the stationary element 30 is located forward of the rotating element 20.

The selection of “puller” or “pusher” configurations may be made in concert with the selection of mounting orientations with respect to the airframe of the intended aircraft application, and some may be structurally or operationally advantageous depending upon whether the mounting location and orientation are wing-mounted, fuselage-mounted, or tail-mounted configurations.

FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate “pusher” embodiments similar to FIG. 6 but wherein the exhaust 80 is located between the stationary element 30 and the rotating element 20. While in both of these embodiments the rotating element 20 is located aft of the stationary element 30, FIGS. 7 and 8 differ from one another in that the rotating element 20 of FIG. 7 incorporates comparatively longer blades than the embodiment of FIG. 8, such that the root 23 of the blades of FIG. 7 is recessed below the airstream trailing aft from the stationary element 30 and the exhaust from the gas generator 40 is directed toward the leading edges of the rotating element 20. In the embodiment of FIG. 8, the rotating element 20 is more nearly comparable in length to the stationary element 30 and the exhaust 80 is directed more radially outwardly between the rotating element 20 and the stationary element 30.

FIGS. 9, 10, and 11 depict other exemplary “pusher” configuration embodiments wherein the rotating element 20 is located forward of the stationary element 30, but both elements are aft of the gas generator 40. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, the exhaust 80 is located aft of both the rotating element 20 and the stationary element 30. In the embodiment of FIG. 10, the exhaust 80 is located forward of both the rotating element 20 and the stationary element 30. Finally, in the embodiment of FIG. 11, the exhaust 80 is located between the rotating element 20 and the stationary element 30.

FIGS. 12 and 13 show different arrangements of the gas generator 40, the low pressure turbine 50 and the rotating element 20. In FIG. 12, the rotating element 20 and the booster 300 are driven by the low pressure turbine 50 directly coupled with the booster 300 and connected to the rotating element 20 via the speed reduction device 60. The high pressure compressor 301 is driven directly by the high pressure turbine 302. In FIG. 13 the rotating element 20 is driven by the low pressure turbine 50 via the speed reduction device 60, the booster 303 is driven directly by the intermediate pressure turbine 306, and the high pressure compressor 304 is driven by the high pressure turbine 305.

FIG. 15 is a cross-sectional schematic illustration taken along lines 15-15 of FIG. 14 illustrating the inlet configuration of the unducted thrust producing system of FIG. 14 as a non-axisymmetric, non-annular inlet. In the configuration shown, the inlet 70 takes the form of a pair of radially-opposed inlets 72 each feeding into the core.

The gas turbine or internal combustion engine used as a power source may employ an inter-cooling element in the compression process. Similarly, the gas turbine engine may employ a recuperation device downstream of the power turbine.

In various embodiments, the source of power to drive the rotating element 20 may be a gas turbine engine fuelled by jet fuel or liquid natural gas, an electric motor, an internal combustion engine, or any other suitable source of torque and power and may be located in proximity to the rotating element 20 or may be remotely located with a suitably configured transmission such as a distributed power module system.

In addition to configurations suited for use with a conventional aircraft platform intended for horizontal flight, the technology described herein could also be employed for helicopter and tilt rotor applications and other lifting devices, as well as hovering devices.

It may be desirable to utilize the technologies described herein in combination with those described in the co-pending applications listed above.

Sept. 12, 1 R. E. WARREN ET AL COMPRESSOR Filed Aug. 8, 1957 u I l u I 2,999,630 COMPRESSOR Robert Evans Warren, Marblehead, Mass., and Felix Ernst Nagel, Columbus, and Gerhard Neumann and Le Var C. Jensen, Cincinnati, Ohio, assignors to General Electric Company, a corporation of New York Filed Aug. 8, 1957, Ser. No. 677,145 1 Claim. ((31. 230-114) This invention relates to an axial flow compressor for a turbojet engine which is provided with adjustable stator vanes, and, in particular, to a means for varying the position of several rows of stator vanes in the compressor of a turbojet engine.

More thrust can be obtained from a turbojet engine by providing a higher pressure ratio compressor for the engine. However, whenever a conventional compressor with fixed stator vanes is designed for high pressure ratio operation, stall characteristics occur during various part speed conditions. This is due to the fact that when a compressor is designed for a high speed, high pressure operating condition, the stator vanes are positioned at a particular angle of attack to give the most eflicient operation. However, at starting and part speed conditions, the angle of attack of the front rows of vanes will become mismatched from the vanes in the rear rows of the compressor so as to create stall. In other words, at the part speed condition, the rear stages cannot take the quantity of air that is being passed to it by the front stages. Accordingly, back pressure is built up so as to choke the compressor. In order to prevent this stall condition, adjustable stator vanes can be provided, so that at starting and part speed conditions the front stages can be closed down with respect to the rear stages and thereby provide the correct airfoil orientation angle for the particular velocity of flowing air. In this manner, a compressor having variable stator vanes overcomes the tendency of poor performance at the off design conditions when adjusting the angle of the stator vanes by rematching the characteristics of the front end stages with that of the back end stages of the compressor. The position of the stator vanes for various operating conditions can be scheduled as a function of engine speed, temperature and pressure. 7

Although many attempts have been made to vary the angles of attack of the rows of stator vanes simultaneously and in accordance with a predetermined schedule for various speeds of the engine, these attempts have failed in view of the various difiiculties of actuating the vanes. Previous attempts have been too cumbersome so as to destroy the purpose of achieving a light-weight, high pressure ratio single rotor compressor utilizing variable stator vanes. That is, the weight is increased to such an extent by previous mechanisms that the advantage gained is offset by the additional weight. Also, the vibrations occurring in the previous mechanisms are of such magnitude as to cause the various mechanical elements of the linkage mechanisms to fail. Further, the degree of accuracy of these mechanisms to control the angle of the stator vanes for satisfactory compressor operation has not been maintained. It is therefore an object of this invention to obviate the above difficulties and to provide a linkage mechanism for adjusting rows of stator vanes that will satisfy the requirements of relatively low weight, high strength, and accuracy of adjustment.

The best angle of attack for a particular row of stator vanes at various speed conditions may vary or be the same from row to row. Therefore, it is another object of this invention to provide a mechanical linkage arrangement that is capable of adjusting a row or rows of stator vanes through either the same, greater, or lesser angle than an adjacent or remote stage of stator vanes in Patented Sept. 1-2, 1961 order that the compressor operate efiioiently at 01f design conditions.

In the past, the adjustable rows of stator vanes have been provided with lever arms, the lever arms being interconnected by an actuating ring, with a means for simultaneously adjusting the rings. However, such a mechanical linkage arrangement is not adapted to fit into the space requirements of most aircraft gas turbines and still adjust the rows of vanes through the wide variations of angles from row to row. This is due to the relatively short length lever arms which are incapable of providing accurate angular movement to set the vanes of one row at their proper angle of attack with respect to the vanes of another row. The relatively large diiference in angle of travel from row to row is such that the previous means could not provide the accuracy with which to adjust the vanes. The lever arms themselves have been unable to accommodate these large differences of travel. In some instances the space limitations require that the actuator ring of one row be positioned in a direction forward of a row of vanes rather than rearward. The mechanical arrangement connected to such an actuating ring must be capable of adjusting the ring in an opposite direction, to adjust the vanes of that row in the same direction as the other rows. It is therefore another object of this invention to provide a mechanical linkage arrangement capable of adjusting the rows of vanes through relatively large different angles and to adjust the actuating rings in opposite directions from a single operating means.

One of the main difficulties encountered in the various variable stator arrangements has been in the bearing for the journal of a variable stator vane. If a ball or roller bearing arrangement is used between the casing and the journal of the variable stator vane, the ball or rollers of the bearing tend to gouge the races as a result of the vibration. Also, the compressor casing must be built up in this area to provide a bearing surface for these bearings. Ball, roller, or just plain journal bearings require lubricant and means to supply the lubricant to the wearing parts. The heat generated in this area tends to decompose the lubricant. In addition, air from the compressor leaks through the prior known bearing means for adjustably supporting the journals of the stator vanes. It is therefore another further object of this invention to supply a bearing for adjustably mounting a stator vane in a compressor casing which bearing requires no lubricant and acts as an air seal to prevent air ieakage from the compressor, in addition to having a low coefficient of friction.

In order to prevent the vibrations created in the com pressor from damaging the parts that go to make up the linkage mechanism for the variable stator, and in order to provide for the required accuracy of angular control of the vanes, the parts must be made to close dimensions and be tightly connected. When making the parts to close dimensions, various problems arise in making such a linkage arrangement operative. For example, one of the difficulties encountered is in the pivotal connection between the levers mounted on the stator vanes and the actuator ring. The pins in the openings of the actuator ring always tend to be directed in a radial direction, The openings in the levers tend to deviate from this radial direction causing the pin to either twist, or cause lever arms to twist. In other words, the actuator ring rotates in an arc of a circle and the lever arm in a plane tangent to this are of a circle so that binding of the parts will result.

It is therefore still a more specific object of this invention to provide a flexible connecting means between the actuating rings and lever arms for permitting the pin to remain in a radial direction without effecting the operation of the lever arms and still maintaining a close fit between these connecting parts.

Briefly stated, and in accordance with one aspect of this invention, a. mechanical linkage arrangement is provided for adjusting the stator vanes of an axial flow compressor which includes anti-friction means which requires no lubricant and acts as a seal, a flexible connection between the lever arms aud the actuating rings so as to eliminate a harmful binding condition, and a linkage arrangement which is adapted to actuate the actuating ring in opposite directions while still adjusting the stator vanes in the same direction.

These and other objects will become more apparent when read in the light of the accompanying drawings and specification wherein like parts have like numbers and wherein the parts are intended to be as generic in their application as the prior art will permit and wherein:

FIGURE 6 is a view showing the fork clip and pin; and

FIGURE 7 is an enlarged view of the lever and actuator ring.

Referring to the figures, the numeral 10 generally designates a compressor casing that is capable of high pressure, high speed operation. The compressor casing is provided with a plurality of radial openings 12, each machined with a flat bearing surface 13 and corresponding to the number of adjustable stator vanes for each particular row or stage and for the number of adjustable rows or stages of vanes. It is noted that all of the rows of stages of vanes can be adjustable or only certain rows adjustable. Mounted in each of the openings 12 is a stator vane 14, connected to a circular support base member 16 in any well known manner such as brazing or welding. Also, the vane and vase can be forged as a single unit.

Although the following description will be made with respect to one stator vane, it is to be understood that the other vanes are constructed in the same manner. The support base member 16 is cylindrical in shape and is provided with a tang or a plurality of tangs 17 extending radially outward from the base member 16 in a direction opposite to the vane 14. The tangs are positioned in a predetermined relation with respect to the vane so as to give the proper angle of attack to the stator vane when the tangs are turned to a desired angular position. Mounted in the opening 12 in the compressor casing is a vane base journal 18 provided with a flat bearing surface 19. It is noted that the vane base journal 18 can be made as an integral part of the casing so as to reduce the number of parts required. In that event the flat bearing surface 19 would then form the bearing seat about opening 12. A collar or bearing cap 21 is positioned on the base support member and extends over the vane base journal 18. The collar or hearing cap 21 is provided with mating recesses or slots 22 so as to fit over the tangs 17. Positioned at each end of the vane base journal and about the circumference of the base support member 16 is sheet material 23 made of polytetraflouraethylene, a well known material. This sheet material separates the casing from the vane assemactuating band and while bly surfaces and not only acts as a seal but provides a dry lubricant surface therebetween. This material has a low coefiicient of friction, needs no lubricant, tends to dampen vibrations, and will not deteriorate under normal operating temperatures or vibratory forces. Further, it can be molded readily into irregular shapes to fit around the base of the stator vane and seat in the compressor casing.

Connected to the center of the support member 16 is a stud member 24. A vane lever arm 26 is mounted on the stud member 24 and is secured thereto by a nut or the like 28. The vane lever arm 26 also contains slots 29 to fit over the tangs 17. The slots 29 and tangs 17 fix the angular position of the vane lever arm with respect to the vane. This mounting arrangement secures the vane lever arm 26 to the base support member 16 of the variable stator vane so that the vane lever arm and the stator vanes move in unison.

The other end of the vane lever arm 26 is provided with an opening 30 so as to receive a rubber grommet assembly 32 or the like, which is fixedly secured therein. The rubber grommet assembly 32 contains an outer member 33 and a small cylindrical bronze or brass member 34, both bonded to a cylindrical rubber sleeve 35. The brass member 34 is adapted to receive the pin 36. The pin 36 has a head 37 thereon, the purpose of which will be more fully hereinafter explained. The rubber sleeve 35 permits twisting of the outer member 33 with respect to the cylindrical brass member 34 which remains in a radial direction. An actuator ring 38 for each stage of adjustable vanes extends circumferentially about the compressor casing and is coaxial therewith. An actuator ring 38 is pivotally connected to each row of vane lever arms 26 by the pin 36 extending through the rubber grommet 32. Since the actuator ring 38 is concentric with the axis of the compressor casing, the pins 36 in the actuator ring will always extend in a radial direction. The opening 30 in the lever arm 26 and outer member 35 will become misaligned with the pin 36 after adjustment from the zero or initial position of the stator vanes. This is due to the fact that the actuator ring moves in an arc of a circle and the lever arm in a plane tangent to the arc of the circle. The rubber grommet 32 will Permit the pin 36 to become misaligned with openings 30 and still permit the actuator ring and lever arms to operate satisfactorily.

In order to secure the pins 36 to the actuator band 38 the pins 36 are provided with circumferential slots or grooves 40 (FIGURE 6). A fork type spring clip 41 provided with circular notches 42 in the fork portion is adapted to be positioned in the groove 40 so as to retain the pin 36 in locking engagement with the actuator band 38 and the vane lever arm 26. This is accomplished by the arms 43 of the fork engaging the one side of the actuator ring and the groove of the pin 36 while the head 37 prevents movement in the other direction.

The number of actuator rings 38 are equal to the number of rows or stages of the variable stator vanes in the compressor. The actuator ring interconnects the lever arms of a row or stage so as to adjust them in unison.

In order to adjust the actuator rings 38 a turnbuckle arrangement 46 is pivotally connected to the actuator ring 38 and to bellcranks 48 at 50. There is one turnbuckle for each stage to provide independent movement of the actuator ring for that stage from the other stages if so desired. The pivotable connection at the turnbuckle includes a self-aligning bearing to prevent binding. This bearing can be a ball and socket arrangement or of the rubber grommet type as shown in FIGURE 2. A bellcrank 48 is pivotally mounted at its fulcrum on the compressor casing as shown at 52. There is one bellcrank for each row of stator vanes. The other end 54 of the bellcrank is attached to a common actuator rod 56.

Since small space requirements and various obstruc- 'the various operating conditions.

tions require a flexible mechanism that can operate the actuating rings in opposite directions, the mechanism as above described can meet these requirements. The inlet guide vanes at 58 are generally mounted in a front frame and connected to the compressor frame through bolted flanges. The inlet guide vanes shovm at 58 are provided with lever arms which are connected to one of the actuator rings 38, which in turn is connected, through a bellcrank 62, to the common actuator rod 56. This arrangement turns the inlet guide vanes in unison with the other variable stator vanes. However, in view of the obstructions and space requirements the bellcrank 62 is reversed from the other bellcranks 48 so as to actuate the actuating rings 38 in a direction opposite to the others. The lever arms on the guide vanes are also reversed. Thus, even though the actuator ring is rotated in the opposite direction from the others, the inlet guide vanes 58 are rotated in the same direction as the others.

It is noted that the length of the lever arms for each stage, and the distances between the pivot points at 50 and 52 on the bellcranks are critical since they vary with different stages in order to give varying amounts of turning movement to the stator vanes of each adjustable stage so as to provide the best angle of attack for the particular operating condition. Use is made of both the lever arm length distance and the distance between the pivot points 50 and 52 to achieve wide variation but accurate adjustment of the rows of stator vanes. In view of the small space consideration and accuracy requirement, adjusting only the lever arms directly has proved to be unsatisfactory. The addition of the bellcranks provide the necessary flexibility to the linkage to overcome the space limitation and meet the accuracy requirement. The dimensions of the lever arms and bellcranks are made in accordance with a predetermined schedule to provide the best angle of attack of the stator vanes for The actuator rod 56 is shown connected to a cylinder 64 which can be either hydraulically or electrically operated. This actuator arrangement for actuating the stator vanes may be automatically operated in response to speed, temperature, or pressure signals measured at the various locations in or outside of the engine.

As pointed out previously, axial flow compressors for turbojet engines have aerodynamic characteristics which vary over a wide range. Some stages of stator vanes may require adjustment through a large angle of travel while others merely require a small angle of travel. However, the space requirements are such that the lever arms might be too small or too large to provide the required accurate aerodynamic adjustment to the stator vanes. The lever arms 26 are not capable of providing the necessary adjustment nor the accuracy required. Accordingly, the bellcranks 48 provide the additional means necessary to adjust the stator vanes so that they can meet the aerodynamic requirements. For example, reference is made to FIGURE 1 in which the lever arms 62 for the inlet guide vanes at 58 are much smaller than the lever arms for some of the other stages of vanes, due to a lack of space. If the aerodynamics require that the inlet guide vanes be adjusted equally with the other stages, and if the lever arms are the only mechanical means for adjusting the vanes, then the aerodynamic requirements could not be met. However, by the use of the bellcranks, the inlet guide vanes can be adjusted equally with the other stages by making the length between points 69 and 63 on the bellcrank smaller by a similar amount.

By this arrangement, any desired angle of adjustment can be provided to any of the stages of stator vanes. For example, some or all can be adjusted equally, or some can be adjusted equally while other stages are adjusted unequally over a wide range. In some cases, the aerodynamics may even require the vanes of a stage to be 6 turned in an opposite direction to the other stages. This can also be accomplished with this arrangement.

Also, as pointed out above, the mechanism for adjusting the inlet guide vanes cannot norrnallly be fitted in the limited space so that the lever arms for the inlet guide vanes are placed on the opposite side from the other lever arms. Therefore, the actuator ring is turned in an opposite direction. This movement in a direction is counteracted by placing the fulcrum 60' of the bellcrank 62 to the right of the pivot point at 63 whereas in the other bellcranks 48 the fulcrum 52 is to the left of the pivot point at 50. Further, if it is desired to adjust all the stages equally, and due to space considertions the lever arms cannot be of the same length, the distance between the pivot points 50 and 52 and 60 and 63 of the bellcranks can be dimensioned in order to make up the difference in length of lever arms and thereby still actuate the stator vanes through the same angle.

In operation, as the engine increases its speed the actuator piston and cylinder arrangement 64 automatically changes the position of the actuating rod 56 and of the bellcranks 48 which in turn actuate the actuator rings 38. Movement of the actuator rings 38 is transmitted to the vane levers 26 through the pins 36. It is noted that as the actuator rings 38 travel circumferentially about the compressor casing, the pins 36 tend to twist the rubber sleeve 35. The rubber grommet 32 permits this twisting to take place without disrupting the operation of the device. Since the actuator rings 38 are supported by the vane lever arms 26, the actuator rings 38 will move in an axial direction as well as in a circumferential direction. Also, the levers 26 have a high degree of stiffness so as to minimize the flexing of the actuator rings.

The purpose of the fork clip 41 is to make it possible to secure the pin 36 in place. Insuflicient space between the actuator band and compressor casing prevents the insertion of a normal bolt and nut or the like. Further, it is desirable that the pin head 37 be flush with the outside of the actuator band. Therefore, the head 37 is positioned in a counter bore as shown in the actuator ring. Also, the pin is so small that threads, or an opening through it, becomes difficult to fabricate and put together. Therefore, the fork clip provides a novel means of retaining a pin in place where size, space and accessibility become important criteria.

It is significant to note that the flat sheet material 23 made of polytetrafluoraethylene serves to function not only as a low friction bearing material between the compressor casing and the base of the stator vanes, but also as a seal to prevent air leakage from the comperssor casing and as a dry lubricant.

The use of flat material allows the base of the stator vianes to be supported on a fiat machined bearing surface on the comperssor casing in a direction perpendicular to the radius of the casing instead of only in a radial direction. This eliminates the necessity of building up the casing at the vane base openings.

The variable stator mechanism is used in such a manner as to control the compresser airflow, thereby making possible the operation of a high pressure ratio compressor with good fuel economy at low Mach numbers even though it is designed for operation at high Mach num-' bers. In addition, the flexibility of the variable stator mechanism allows high air flows at high Mach numbers, thus increasing the available thrust at the high Mach number condition. This variable stator design permits the construction of a simple single rotor compressor compatible with the lightweight design objectives of an aircraft turbojet engine.

While a particular embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention, and it is intended to cover in the appended claim all such spirit and scope of the invention.

What we claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States is:

MULTI-STAGE CIRCULATORS Filed Jan. 29, 1964 2 Sheets-Sheet 1 INVENTOR 495W: J4 5 BY ATTORNEY Jan. 10, 1967 H. JAHNS 3,297,307

MULTI-STAGE CIRCULATORS Filed Jan. 29, 1964 2 Sheets-Sheet 2 INVENTOR BY f:

ATTORNEY United States Patent Ofifice 3,297,307 Patented Jan. 10, 1967 Claims. cl. 259-97 The present invention relates to circulators and particularly multi-state axial flow circulators with variable or adjustable delivery.

With multi-stage axial flow circulators having adjustable delivery, the delivery may be controlled by changing the speed of rotation of the drive motor or by adjusting the runner or guide vanes.

In case of control of the delivery by variation of the speed of rotation, there are required either expensive drive motors with variable speeds or expensive transmissions.

If the control of the delivery is to be effected by adjustment of the runner or guide-vanes, there is required an expensive mechanism which is subject to wear and which can easily lead to malfunctions and to the failure in operation.

It is not desirable to control the delivery of a singlestage axial-flow circulator or agitator by closing the inlet or outlet connections of the circulator or agitator and conducting the liquid to be conveyed through openings arranged radially in the circulator or agitator housing which may be closed or opened to a greater or lesser extent by a rotatable ring having corresponding openings in it.

In this embodiment, the path of the liquids to be conveyed extends exclusively through the radial openings in the circulator or agitator housing and the liquid being conveyed is thus unavoidably throttled in front of the radial openings. In this way, even if the openings are complete ly open, the efiiciency of the circulator is quite low.

It is a feature of the present invention to control the delivery of a multi-stage axial-flow circulator or agitator by providing closable outlet openings in the cylindrical part of a circulator or agitator housing, provided with unrestricted free inlet and outlet areas before the last stage.

The path of the medium to be conveyed in the circulator or agitator of the invention extends through the unblocked inlet and outlet openings which do not obstruct the flow, while the control of the delivery is effected by the quantity discharging from the outlet openings of the circulator or agitator housing before the last stage of the circulator or agitator.

In such circulators having one or more guide-vane rings, the outlet openings are arranged in the area of the guide-vane ring before the last stage of the circulator or agitator. By this arrangement, it is possible to reduce the delivery of the entire circulator or agitator to substantially the output of the last stage.

The outlet openings may be opened or entirely or partially closed by a rotatable ring, having openings which correspond to the outlet openings.

In order to adjust the circulator or agitator intended for installation in closed pressure vessels and particularly high temperature dyeing machines, the rotatable ring is shifted by an adjustment member actuated from the outside of the vessel into the closed position or into position for part or full opening of the outlet openings.

For this purpose for instance, the ring may be brought into the proper control position by an adjustment member actuated from the outside.

To accomplish this, the ring is turned in one embodiment by a bell crank lever which in its turn is adjustable by a rod on which the spindle of a hand wheel acts.

The circulator or agitator may be inserted, together with the adjusting mechanism as a single enclosed unit, into an opening in a pressure container for a liquid processing or textile dyeing operations and flange onto the edge of the opening therein.

With the foregoing and other objects in view, the invention consists of the novel construction, combination and arrangement of parts as hereinafter more specifically described, and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein is shown an embodiment of the invention, but it is to be understood that changes, variations and modifications can be resorted to which fall within the scope of the claims hereunto appended.

In the drawings wherein like reference characters denote corresponding parts throughout the several views:

FIG. 1 is a side elevation of a two-state axial-flow circulator or agitator shown in horizontal position with an adjustment mechanism.

FIG. 2 is a side elevation of the same circulator or agitator partially in longitudinal section.

FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 are fragmentary cross-sections along the line II of FIG. 1 respectively showing the outlet openings blocked, partially opened and fully open.

The circulator housing 1 bears on its cylindrical housing portion 2 two guide rings 3. Between the rings 3, there is rotatably supported a movable sleeve 5 provided with ports 4 and this sleeve is held in position by the guide-rings 3. The ports 4 in the position of the ring 3, as shown in FIG. 1, partially open outlet openings 6 in the cylindrical portion 2 of the pump housing 1.

The rotatable ring 5 bears an outwardly projecting radial extension 7 which lodges or fits in an opening 8 of the bell crank lever 10. The lever 10 is pivotally sup ported on a pivot pin 9 on the pump housing 1.

On the other end of the bell crank lever 10, the pin 11 projects on both sides and engages the fork-shaped or clevis end of the rod 12. The rod 12 extends to the lever 14 supported on a pivot pin 13 mounting on the housing 1. The lever 14 is actuated on the other end opposite the rod 12 by the reciprocable spindle 15.

The spindle 15 extends through the periphery of flange 16 of the pump housing 1. The flange 16 may be bolted to the edge of the opening in a pressure container after the circulator has been inserted into said pressure container.

A stuffing box 17 assures a liquid tight bearing of the spindle 15 through the flange 16.

A hand wheel or member 18 is fixed onto the outer extension of the spindle 15. By turning the hand wheel 18, the spindle 15, which may be provided with a threaded section, is reciprocated. The member 19 may be threaded onto the spindle 15. The axial displacement of the spindle 15 will move the lever 14, the rod 12, the bell crank lever 13 and the sleeve 5 so that the outlet openings 6 are closed or opened to a greater or lesser extent.

As shown in FIG. 2, the outlet openings 6 are located in the region of the guide vane sleeve 20.

The embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 stage axialflow circulator is intended in particular for circulators with varying direction of delivery since for each direction of delivery the outlet openings 6 in the region of the guidevane sleeve 21 are positioned before the last stage of the circulator.

For three or more stage circulators with varying direction of delivery, it is adsivable to provide behind the first and in front of the last stages of the circulator, closable outlet openings in order to be able for both directions of delivery to effect the control of the delivery in each case in front of the final stage.

In FIG. 3, the sleeve 5 closes the outlet openings 6 completely. In this position, the circulator operates with the maximum delivery.

In FIGURE 4, the outlet openings 6 are partially opened by the ports 4 of the sleeve 5 whereby a part of the liquid to be conveyed emerges prematurely from the circulator housing so that the delivery of the circulator is reduced.

Finally, in FIG. 5, the ports 4 of the sleeve 5 fully open the outlet. openings 6 of the circulator housing. In this way the minimum delivery of the circulator is obtained without the efiiciency of the circulator being impaired by a large throttling action.

The circulator housing 1 itself may have a conical end portion 30 terminating in the mounting flange 16. The central shaft 31 may drive the liquid impelling members 32 and the wall of the pressure container may be diagrammatically indicated at 33.

The sleeves 34 with fixed intermediate ported sleeve 20 form the housing 1 with the unobsetructed inlet and outlet fiow passages 35 and 36.

As many changes could be made in the above multistage circulators and many Widely different embodiments of this invention could be made without departure from the scope of the claims, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description shall be interpreted as i1- lustrative and not in a limiting sense.

Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of the invention, and in what manner the same is to be performed, what is claimed is:

1. In a fluid circulator system, a pressure container and a multi-stage axial flow circulator mounted within said pressure container for liquid processing, said circulator having a cylindrical pump housing composed of a plurality of cylindrical fixed sleeves, a plurality of stages ranging from the first stage to the last stage including a central shaft driving a plurality of liquid activating members arranged so that there Will be one member for each stage and one member within each sleeve, one stage of said pump having its fixed sleeve provided with a plurality of ports therein around the periphery thereof and a movable porting sleeve positioned around said ported sleeve with a plurality of matching ports and means to move said movable sleeve to open and close the ports in the fixed ported sleeve.

'3 Claims.

The present invention relates to combined storage tanks and mixing machines. It is especially well adapted for use as a storage tank and mixing machine for paint and in the following specification and in thedrawing, I have specifically described. and illustrated this application of my invention. It is to be understood, however, that this is only by way of example and that the invention is not limited thereto necessarily.

The object of the invention is to provide an improved construction and arrangement in a machine of this type which will effect rapid mixing and from which a well mixed portion will be drawn off when the mixed material is to be used.

For a consideration of what I believe to be novel and my invention, attention is directed to the following specification and the claims appended thereto.

In the drawing, Fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of a storage tank and mixing machine embodying the invention; Fig. 2 is a detail sectional View through the discharge valve; Fig. 3 is a top plan View and Fig. 4 is a sectional view of one of the impellers; Fig. 5 is a sectional view taken on the line 55, Fig. 1.

Referring to the drawing, 1 indicates the side walls of the storage tank which may be rectangular in cross section, 2 indicates the top wall and 3 indicates the bottom wall. The top wall 2 is provided with aiilling opening closed by a removable cover 4. The bottom wall 3 is dish V shaped, providing a centrally located low portion 5 to which the adjacent slopingwalls direct the flow of paint or othermaterial to be mixed.

Located in the tank is an impeller tube or mixing tube 6 supported from cover 2 by a plurality of straps 7. Straps 7 may be suitably Welded to tube 6 and fastened to the cover by screws 8. Tube 6 is supported in spaced relation to central portion 5 so as to leave a space 9 at the bottom of tube 6 through which may terial may flow into the tube. Inside tube 6 is an impeller shaft 10 on which is mounted a plurality of impellers 11, two being shown in the present instance. One impeller is located at the lower end of tube 6 and the other is located about centrally thereof. On each side of impellers 11 are suitable bafilers 12 which may be fastened to tube 6 by set screws such as are indicated at 13. Each baiiler comprises an outer wall 14 connected by spokes 15 and a central hub 16. The lower end of shaft 10 makes a nice fit with the lowermost hub 16 which forms a bearing for the lower end of the shaft. The

shaft passes loosely through the hubs of the other baiilers. I-lub 16 of the lowermost bafiler is supported on bottom wall 3, beingsuitably fastened thereto. Bythis arrangement, it forms also a rigid support for the lower end of tube 6. Each impeller comprises a hub 16 on which is mounted a spirally extending disk 17. Hub 16 is fastened to shaft 10 by a set screw or other suitablemeans.

The, upper end of shaft 10 is'connected'to the shaft of an electric motor 18 which is vertically mounted in a casing 19 supported on tank top 2. At 26 is a step bearing on which shaft-10 is hung; Fastened to straps 7 is a disk 21 .1ocated in spaced relation to the upper end of tube 6 and serving as a bafiler for directing outwardly fluid flowing from the, top of tube 6. Fastened to shaft 10 above disk 21 is a disk 22 which func-. tions as a bearing guard for step bearing 20.

Connected to tube 6, adjacent to its upper'end and above the normal maximum liquid leveljin the tank, is a discharge pipe 23, which at its outer end is connected to a discharge valve or faucet 24. Faucet 24 is provided with a flange 25 which is suitably attached to the side wall 1 8.0

' of the tank. The faucet has a discharge port 26 and a passage 2'? which connects with a pipe 28 leading back into the tank. Attached to faucet 24 is a suitable hand valve for closing and opening port 26. In the present instance, it is shown as comprising a shoe 29 carried by a yoke 30 pivoted on the casing of faucet 24. Attached to the yoke is a handle 31 for moving the valve. 32 and 33 are stops for limiting the movement of the valve, stop 33 being made adjustable 9 so that the opening movement may be adjustably controlled. ,Shoe 29 is pressed into engagement with the end wall of the valve casing by a spring 34 located in a recess inhandle 31, the spring pressing against a spacing block 35 which in turn engages'the adjacent wall of shoe 29. Shoe 29 is provided with a flange 36 which slides on the yoke to form a guide and support ing means for the shoe. Spring '34 serves to press the shoe tightly against the end of valve casing and hold it in such position. In Fig. 1 the valve is shown closed and in Fig. 2 it is shown open.

At the lower end of the tank is an inverted cone shaped deflecting wall 37 supported by 19 ears 33 attached to side walls 1 adjacent to their lower ends, it being provided with a central opening through which tube 6 extends. Tube 6 serves to hold the edges of wall 37 in spaced relation to side walls 1 providing thereby a marginal passage 40 through which paint flows to bottom wall 3.

In the use of the device, paint in a mixed or partially mixed state or ingredients in suitable proportions to form paint are introduced through the opening in top wall 2, dotted line A indicating the maximum height to which the tank is to be filled. Motor 18 is then started, rotating impellers 11 in a direction to effect an upward flow of paint through tube 6. The paint is I caused to flow rapidly up through tube 6 to its upper end where it is discharged partly over the end of the tube beneath disk 21 and partly through pipe 23, casing of valve 24 and pipe 28. The paint is circulated continuously, flowing down Wall 3'7 to wall 3 and then down wall 3 to the lower end of tube 6. This circulation and the beating action of the impellers effects rapid and complete mixing of the ingredients. When it is desired to utilize some of the paint, it is drawn olf by opening valve 24, the valve being opened partially or entirely as found desirable.

Qrdinarily, after the paint has been once mixed, motor 18 is shut down, it being run only when it is desired to draw some paint from. the tank. Whenever the motor is started up to draw paint, a rapid circulation and mixing of the contents of the tank is effected by the 1% i.- pellers. Only a small amount of the total paint being circulated is drawn oil? when the valve is opened. This means that when paint is being drawn from the tank, it is thoroughly mixed as it is drawn oil. In other words, whenever the motor is being operated and paint is being drawn off, a relatively large stream of paint is put into circulation while a relatively small portion of such stream is discharged through valve port 26. This means that always a uniform mixture will be discharged through the valve. In. this connection, it is to be noted that the pain drawn off is a part of the paint being circulated, this result being obtained because pipe 23 is connected to tube 6 above the normal maximum paint level. This means that always the motor must be started up and the paint put into circulation before paint can be drawn off.

With the above described arrangement, the paint is stored in a tank from which it may be drawn readily. No hand mixing of the paint is necessary, a thing which saves considerable time, and always a uniform product is discharged through the faucet. I

The device is simple in structure, clean and efficient in operation, prevents waste of and is capable of being manufactured at low cost.

While I have shown two impellers with bafflers on each side of them, it will be understood-that he device may be operated with a single imler or with more than two impellers and that e bafllers may be omitted, if found desirable.

This invention relates to turbines and whilst in certain constructional aspects it is of more general application, it has particular value and utility in relation to gas turbine power plant of variable speed of the kind which drives both a compressor supplying working fluid to the plant, and a further power-absorbing unit, particularly one having a fixed horse power/speed characteristic. More specifically stated, the invention is of particular value and utility in controlling aircraft gas turbine power plant of variable speed which, as well as driving a compressor is also required to drive an airscrew or a ducted fan and, may be, to provide a propulsive jet.

It can be shown that when an open cycle gas turbine is operating at less than its full rated speed both the output efficiency and the maximum turbine temperature may be reduced as compared with the efliciency and temperature at full speed, and it is an object of the invention to improve output at speeds below the maximum. The invention is based on the realisation that under such partial load conditions the output may be improved by increasing the maximum turbine temperature to its maximum permissi ble value, and also that if a compressor is used the mass fiow therethrough should be such as to give maximum compressor efficiency for the speed of rotation in question. The turbine temperature can be increased by supplying more fuel for combustion, but whilst such an arrangement has proved adequate in the case of a simple jetpropulsion power plant, if the air flow through the compressor is kept below its optimum value for the prevailing rotational speed due to increased fuel supply necessitated by the presence of a load, such as a propeller or a ducted fan, having a fixed or insufiiciently variable horse power/speed characteristic, there may not be any resulting increase in the overall output of the plant, due to surging 'or'other effects in the system arising from a deficient air mass flow, certain axial flow types of compressor being particularly sensitive in this respect. Furthermore, when the plant is requiredfto drive a powerabsorbing unit having a fixed horse power/Speed characteristic, experience has shown that the power output of the turbine at less than its full rated speed may not be suificient to drive the power-absorbing unit.' If, in such circumstances, it is sought to attain stability by reducing the power absorption of the unit (for example, by varying blade pitch or, in the case of a ducted fan, by providing for variable pre-whirl of the entering fiuid) stability may in fact be attained but the efficiency is likely to be lower than at full power. Moreover, in some cases, such as that of a ducted fan, only a small variation in the power absorption may be practicable.

Figure 1 is a graph plotting horsepower against revolutions per minute;

Figure 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of an aircraft gas turbine power unit constructed in accordance with this invention;

Figure 3 is a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view of a portion of Figure 2 showing one embodiment of the invention;

Figure 4 is also a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view of a portion of Figure 2 showing another embodiment of the invention; and

Figure 5 is a longitudinal sectional vie w'of an expansion joint constructed in accordance with this invention.

The situation intended to be dealt with by the invention in its control as opposed to its contructional aspect will be more readily understood by reference to Figure 1 of the accompany drawings in which power and temperature are plotted against speed, and in which curve 'I represents a possible variation of turbine temperature with speed, given fixed turbine admission; curve 2 similarly represents engine horse power variation with fixed admission and curve 3 the variation in the power absorption of an element of fixed horse power/speed characteristic which exceeds the power available below design speed,

In order to meet the difficulties described in the foregoing the present invention contemplates the control of turbine temperature by varying the turbine admission in correspondence with the compressor mass flow so as to maintain a, high turbine temperature and also an admission suited to the compressor mass flow under varying conditions, the arrangement, according to a further feature of the invention, preferably being such that at all times total admission is maintained; that is to say, the distribution of the fluid admission around the periphery of the turbine always remains the same. By this means, in conjunction with appropriate adjustment of the fuel supply, it becomes possible in the case of gas turbines of the kinds referred to, to vary the turbine temperature at will, so that this temperature may be kept at a constant maximum permissible value at all turbine speeds, as indicated by line 4 in Figure 1, or at least may, be maintained nearer to this value than would otherwise be the case, with a consequent improvement in the power output of the turbine at speeds below the maximum such as is indicated by the engine power curve 5, Figure l, and whilst taking account of the accompanying modification of the compressor air mass flow so as to avoid complications in relation to the compressor.

An arrangement whereby the control may take place entirely automatically is illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 2 as applied to an aircraft gas turbine power unit comprisingan axial flow type of compressor 3 supplying air by way of a combustion system Ito a turbine 6' which drives the compressorfi and also (for example) a ducted fan type propulsion element 9, the exhaust of the turbine being in this case considered as affording apropulsive jet, although the invention may be applied irrespectively of whether the turbine exhaust or the ducted fan, or both, are used to afiord a propulsive jet. In accordance with the invention the turbine 8 has a variable admission nozzle operable to vary the admission by, say, an oil pressure system H of any convenient kind, the supply to which is controlled by movement or"" the output element l2 of a differential gear, one of whose input elements I3 is driven from the compressor shaft by mechanical gearing indicated at M and the other from an anemometer l operated by the air flow through the compressor. By appropriate selection of gear ratios it can be arranged that there will be resultant movement of the differential output element i2 only when the compressor is operating off its designed speed/flow ratio, under which conditions appropriate adjustment or"" the turbine admission will be effected. At the same time, the fuel supply It is controlled from a thermostat I! in the hot gas flow giving a measure of the turbine inlet temperature and acting to increase the supply of fuel with a fall of temperature, the fuel supply having a manual overriding control indicated at 16a.

In accordance with a further feature of the invention variation in the turbine admission is obtained by the use of a nozzle ring having guide blades individually adjustable to vary the cross section of the intervening admission passages; for example such guide blades may be pivotally mounted for rotation about axes extending radially of the nozzle ring.

In achieving a satisfactory blade mounting there are a number of problems arising out of the high temperatures at which the turbine admission takes place; further constructional features of the invention designed to ofier a solution to these problems, but incidentally of wider application, will appear from the following description, given by way of example, of th practical constructional embodiments of a variable admission nozzle ring illustrated in axial section in Figures 3, 4 and 5 in which it is assumed that the invention is applied to an aircraft gas turbine power plant of the general form illustrated in Figure 2 and comprising an air compressor (not seen in Figures 3 and 4) discharging into a combustion chamber 1 from which the combustion products pass by way of a bladed nozzle rin to an axial flow turbine 8.

In the construction proposed, the nozzle assembly comprises rigid and relatively substantial concentric blade-supporting rings 2! 2! attached to or forming part of the main structure 22 of the plant and each having radially aligned holes to receive inner and outer pivot pins 23, 24 of the blades 25. The latter are of the usual '4 or desired aerofoil cross section to afford between them admission throats of varying cross section and each has at its radially inner end a spigot 23 which is pivotally located in the corresponding hole of the inner supporting r ng 28 by means of a carbon bush 23 in order to avoid the need for normal lubrication. The outer ends of the blades are similarly pivoted in carbon bushes 21, except that in this case,

for assembly reasons, the spigot 28 is detachably secured to the blade by a screw 29 passing axially through the spigot and accessible from outside the supporting ring 2|, whilst the spigot has on the radially inner side of said ring 21 a locating shoulder 30 and is further positively located in the radial sense by a shoulder 3| at its radially outer end formed by an oversize washer element held in position by the spigot holding screw 2!.

The respective blade-supporting rings 28, 2| are, in general; of channel form, with their open sides presented to the gas stream, and shrouding 32, 33 is provided across these open sides to define the inner and outer walls of the nozzle between which the guide blades extend. This shrouding also serves, in conjunction with the respective channel form rings, to define annular chambers 34, 35 enclosing the root ends of the inner and outer spigots, which chambers are placed'in communication with a supply of cooling air or fluid to provide a flow of coolant therethrough as indicated by the arrows. Similarly, an outer casing 36 may define with the outer blade supporting ring 2! a further annular chamber 31 enclosing the radially outer ends of the outer spigots 24 and having provision for a fiow of coolant therethrough. By means of this arrangement the supporting rings 20, 2| and the pivots of the guide blades can be kept at a relatively low temperature. The blades 25 themselves and the shrouding 32, 33 of course, must operate at the maximum turbine temperature and in order to prevent binding between these parts the shrouding, in the first place, is provided with inset ceramic washers 38 designed to maintain an appropriate clearance between it and the blades, and in the second place is constructed of a plurality of peripherally extending segments interconnected by expansion joints which are adapted to permit the segments of the shroud to expand and contract without variation of its diameter. In practice the shrouds 32, 33, being in effect attached to the blades by the passage of the spigots 23, 24 therethrough, have their diameters determined by that of the blades and the blade-supporting rings, so that notwithstanding expansion and contraction of the latter the blade clearance remains constant. As illustrated in the scrap view of Figure 5, the expansion joints may be provided by thin metal strips'35 entering slots in the adjacent ends of pairs of shroud segments 32, 33 sufiicient endclearance being left in the slots to accommodate the expansion of these segments.

In order to allow control of the blade setting as required, the inner spigot 23 of each blade has attached thereto a lever arm 40 extending axially of the turbine and co-operating at its free end with an adjuster ring 41 mounted for rotation about the turbine axis, adjustment of the ring effecting rotation of all the nozzle blades 25 about their radial pivots and thus, by reason of the normal differential shaping of the adjacent blade surfaces, varying the admissionarea of the individual nozzle throats. Preferably the blade op'erating lever arms l-il should be as long as practicable to minimise the effect of any play that might develop in theblade bearings.

The control mechanism may also include provision for individual adjustment of the blade settings, and this may take the-form of an adjustable connection between the ldlade-op'erating lever arms 46 and the adjusterring 41. Thus, each said connection may be afforded by. a radially extending finger 42 whose-free end engages a socket in the adjuster ring 4| and which is mounted on the shorter arm 43 of a bladesetting lever pivoted at 44 on the associated blade-operating lever arm 40, the longer arm 45 of said blade setting lever being associated with a locking nut 46 or other means by which the setting lever may be locked in any of a plurality of positions.

The construction illustrated in Figure 4 is generally similar to that illustrated in Figures 3 and 5, and differs therefrom mainly in the omission of the ceramic washers 38, the clearance from the shroud being afforded by raised parts of the latter; the application of the lever arms 4!) to the outer ends of the blades; and the use of a less sensitive form of individual adjustment for the blades, which in this case employs an eccentric rotatably adjustable arrangement of the pin 42 engaging the adjuster ring 4|.

Whilst the control aspect of the invention has been considered primarily with reference to its applications to a particular class of gas turbine power plant, it will be appreciated that the constructional features of the variable admission nozzle described are applicabl to other classes of turbine, including steam turbines, in which it may be desired to provide variable admission.

The type of control made possible by the invention is considered to have application to gas turbines of the kind referred to employing complex cycles in which the working gas operates a plurality of turbines. In this case, it becomes possible to regulat the power output of the constituent turbines without producing undesirable disturbance of the compressor flow.

This is a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. § 371(c) of prior-filed, co-pending, PCT application serial number PCT/US2013/066383, filed on Oct. 23, 2013, which claims priority to Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/717,451 filed Oct. 23, 2012 and titled “PROPELLER AERODYNAMIC LOADING DISTRIBUTION”, and is related to PCT application serial number PCT/US2013/066392, titled “UNDUCTED THRUST PRODUCING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE” filed on Oct. 23, 2013, and PCT application serial number PCT/US2013/066403, titled “VANE ASSEMBLY FOR A PROPULSION SYSTEM” filed on Oct. 23, 2013. All of the above listed applications are herein incorporated by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The technology described herein relates to an unducted thrust producing system, particularly a spanwise aerodynamic loading distribution for rotating elements that are paired with stationary elements. The technology is of particular benefit when applied to “open rotor” gas turbine engines.

Gas turbine engines employing an open rotor design architecture are known. A turbofan engine operates on the principle that a central gas turbine core drives a bypass fan, the fan being located at a radial location between a nacelle of the engine and the engine core. An open rotor engine instead operates on the principle of having the bypass fan located outside of the engine nacelle. This permits the use of larger fan blades able to act upon a larger volume of air than for a turbofan engine, and thereby improves propulsive efficiency over conventional engine designs.

Optimum performance has been found with an open rotor design having a fan provided by two contra-rotating rotor assemblies, each rotor assembly carrying an array of airfoil blades located outside the engine nacelle. As used herein, “contra-rotational relationship” means that the blades of the first and second rotor assemblies are arranged to rotate in opposing directions to each other. Typically the blades of the first and second rotor assemblies are arranged to rotate about a common axis in opposing directions, and are axially spaced apart along that axis. For example, the respective blades of the first rotor assembly and second rotor assembly may be co-axially mounted and spaced apart, with the blades of the first rotor assembly configured to rotate clockwise about the axis and the blades of the second rotor assembly configured to rotate counter-clockwise about the axis (or vice versa). In appearance, the fan blades of an open rotor engine resemble the propeller blades of a conventional turboprop engine.

The use of contra-rotating rotor assemblies provides technical challenges in transmitting power from the power turbine to drive the airfoil blades of the respective two rotor assemblies in opposing directions.

It would be desirable to provide an open rotor propulsion system utilizing a single rotating propeller assembly analogous to a traditional bypass fan which reduces the complexity of the design, yet yields a level of propulsive efficiency equal to or better than contra-rotating propulsion design.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
An unducted thrust producing system has a rotating element with an axis of rotation and a stationary element. The rotating element includes a plurality of blades each having a blade root proximal to the axis, a blade tip remote from the axis, and a blade span measured between the blade root and the blade tip. The rotating element has a load distribution such that at any location between the blade root and 30% span the value of ΔRCu in the air stream is greater than or equal to 60% of the peak ΔRCu in the air stream.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
In all of the Figures which follow, like reference numerals are utilized to refer to like elements throughout the various embodiments depicted in the Figures.

FIG. 1 shows an elevational cross-sectional view of an exemplary unducted thrust producing system 10. As is seen from FIG. 1, the unducted thrust producing system 10 takes the form of an open rotor propulsion system and has a rotating element 20 depicted as a propeller assembly which includes an array of blades 21 around a central longitudinal axis 11 of the unducted thrust producing system 10. Unducted thrust producing system 10 also includes in the exemplary embodiment a non-rotating stationary element 30 which includes an array of vanes 31 also disposed around central axis 11. These vanes may be arranged such that they are not all equidistant from the propeller, and may optionally include an annular shroud or duct 100 distally from axis 11 (as shown in FIG. 2) or may be unshrouded. These vanes are mounted to a stationary frame and do not rotate relative to the central axis 11. For reference purposes, FIG. 1 also depicts a Forward direction denoted with arrow F.

As shown in FIG. 1, the exemplary unducted thrust producing system 10 also includes a drive mechanism 40 which provides torque and power to the rotating element 20 through a transmission 50. In various embodiments, the drive mechanism 40 may be a gas turbine engine, an electric motor, an internal combustion engine, or any other suitable source of torque and power and may be located in proximity to the rotating element 20 or may be remotely located with a suitably configured transmission 50. Transmission 50 transfers power and torque from the drive mechanism 40 to the rotating element 20 and may include one or more shafts, gearboxes, or other mechanical or fluid drive systems.

Airfoil blades 21 of rotating element 20 are sized, shaped, and configured to produce thrust by moving a working fluid such as air in a direction Z as shown in FIG. 1 when the rotating element 20 is rotated in a given direction around the longitudinal axis 11. In doing so, blades 21 impart a degree of swirl to the fluid as it travels in the direction Z. Vanes 31 of the stationary element are sized, shaped, and configured to decrease the swirl magnitude of the fluid, so as to increase the kinetic energy that generates thrust for a given shaft power input to the rotating element. For both blades and vanes, span is defined as the distance between root and tip. Vanes 31 may have a shorter span than blades 21, as shown in FIG. 1, for example, 50% of the span of blades 21, or may have longer span or the same span as blades 21 as desired. Vanes 31 may be attached to an aircraft structure associated with the propulsion system, as shown in FIG. 1, or another aircraft structure such as a wing, pylon, or fuselage. Vanes 31 of the stationary element may be fewer or greater in number than, or the same in number as, the number of blades 21 of the rotating element and typically greater than two, or greater than four, in number.

Vanes 31 of the stationary element 30 may be positioned aerodynamically upstream of the blades 21 so as to serve as counter swirl vanes, i.e., imparting a tangential velocity which is opposite to the rotation direction of the rotating element 20. Alternatively, and as shown in FIG. 1, vanes 31 may be positioned aerodynamically downstream of the blades 21 so as to serve as de-swirl vanes, i.e., imparting a change in tangential velocity which is counter to that of the rotating element 20. Any swirl remaining in the airstream downstream of the propulsion system 10 equates to a loss in thrust producing kinetic energy.

It may be desirable that either or both of the sets of blades 21 and vanes 31 incorporate a pitch change mechanism such that the blades and vanes can be rotated with respect to an axis of pitch rotation either independently or in conjunction with one another. Such pitch change can be utilized to vary thrust and/or swirl effects under various operating conditions, including to provide a thrust reversing feature which may be useful in certain operating conditions such as upon landing an aircraft.

FIG. 3 depicts the change in Cu across the rotating and stationary elements, where Cu is the circumferential averaged tangential velocity. Vector diagrams are shown in a coordinate system in which the axial direction is in the downward direction and tangential direction is left to right. Multiplying the Cu times the airstream radius R gives the property RCu. The blade or vane loading at a given radius R is now defined as the change in RCu across the blade row (at a constant radius or along a streamtube), here forth referred to as ΔRCu and is a measure of the elemental specific torque of said blade row. Desirably, the ΔRCu for the rotating element should be in the direction of rotation throughout the span.

FIG. 4 is a graphical depiction of the aerodynamic load distribution vs. span of the rotating element 20 of the exemplary unducted thrust producing system 10. FIG. 4 illustrates three curves. The curve with the diamonds is a loading distribution for a conventional propeller assembly optimized for minimum wasted/unused kinetic energy for a single rotation propeller with no de-swirl system. The curves with the squares and triangles are a loading distributions for exemplary embodiments of the unducted thrust producing system 10 described herein. As shown in FIG. 4, both curves for the exemplary embodiment have a more uniform ΔRCu over the span, particularly in the region between the blade root and midspan. In fact, at a location of 30% span the value of ΔRCu is greater than or equal to 60% of the maximum value of ΔRCu, and, in an embodiment, is greater than or equal to 70% of the maximum value of ΔRCu, and, in an embodiment, is greater than or equal to 80% of the maximum value of ΔRCu. ΔRCu is measured across the rotating element (propeller blade row) in a conventional manner. Blades 21 are sized, shaped, and configured to deliver this loading distribution using techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Exemplary embodiments described herein demonstrate a particular distribution of ΔRCu across the blade of a rotating element or propeller assembly including a stationary element comprised of either de-swirl vanes or upstream counter-swirl vanes. In the design process this ΔRCu will be used in conjunction with the aircraft flight velocity, the rotational speed of the rotor, and the overall thrust required from the assembly to define the vector diagrams of the air.

FIG. 5 depicts swirl, Cu, and axial velocity, Vz, at the exit of the unducted thrust producing system. FIG. 5 illustrates four curves. The curves with the diamonds and “x” symbols are for two conventional configurations, rotor only and conventional rotor with de-swirl vanes, respectively. The curves with squares and triangles are for two exemplary embodiments described herein. Compared to the conventional configurations, the embodiments have less exit swirl and more uniform axial velocity, indicating lower wasted kinetic energy in the exit stream and more energy converted into useful thrust.

FIG. 6 depicts graphically how various parameters such as camber and stagger angle are defined with respect to a blade or vane. An airfoil meanline is a described as a line that bisects the airfoil thickness (or is equidistant from the suction surface and pressure surface) at all locations. The meanline intersects the airfoil at leading edge and trailing edge. The camber of an airfoil is defined as the angle change between the tangent to the airfoil meanline at the leading edge and the tangent to the angle meanline at the trailing edge. The stagger angle is defined as the angle the chord line makes with the centreline axis. Reference line 44 is parallel to axis 11, and reference line 55 is orthogonal to reference line 44.

In addition to the noise reduction benefit the duct 100 shown in FIG. 2 provides a benefit for vibratory response and structural integrity of the stationary vanes 31 by coupling them into an assembly forming an annular ring or one or more circumferential sectors, i.e., segments forming portions of an annular ring linking two or more vanes 31 such as pairs forming doublets. The duct 100 may allow the pitch of the vanes to be varied as desired.

A significant, perhaps even dominant, portion of the noise generated by the disclosed fan concept is associated with the interaction between wakes and turbulent flow generated by the upstream blade-row and its acceleration and impingement on the downstream blade-row surfaces. By introducing a partial duct acting as a shroud over the stationary vanes, the noise generated at the vane surface can be shielded to effectively create a shadow zone in the far field thereby reducing overall annoyance. As the duct is increased in axial length, the efficiency of acoustic radiation through the duct is further affected by the phenomenon of acoustic cut-off, which can be employed, as it is for conventional aircraft engines, to limit the sound radiating into the far-field. Furthermore, the introduction of the shroud allows for the opportunity to integrate acoustic treatment as it is currently done for conventional aircraft engines to attenuate sound as it reflects or otherwise interacts with the liner. By introducing acoustically treated surfaces on both the interior side of the shroud and the hub surfaces upstream and downstream of the stationary vanes, multiple reflections of acoustic waves emanating from the stationary vanes can be substantially attenuated.

Following a design process blade geometries will be defined that create the desired vector diagrams as illustrated in FIG. 3. While the fundamental desired characteristic is a torque distribution, this will result in a blade geometry designed to achieve the desired torque distribution. An illustration of the change in geometry required to produce the desired torque characteristic, when compared to that currently optimum for a single rotation propeller without de-swirl vane, is shown in FIG. 7. It can be seen that this leads to a change in the blade cambers in the inner portion of the blade, i.e., from about 0 to approximately 50% span, and it is expected that characteristics of exemplary embodiments could also be loosely defined by a camber distribution. At least one of the following criteria are met: at 30% span the blade camber is at least 90% of the max camber level between 50% and 100% span; and the 0% span camber is at least 110% of the max camber between 50% and 100% span.

FIG. 8 is an elevational view of an exemplary airfoil blade 21, such as depicted in FIG. 1 for use with an unducted thrust producing system as described herein, with section line locations 1 through 11 identified with section 1 being the blade tip and section 11 being the blade root. The blade span is measured between the root and the tip. FIGS. 9 through 19 sequentially illustrate airfoil blade cross-sections at section line locations 1 through 11 for both an exemplary airfoil blade 21 and analogous sections through the conventional airfoil blade referenced previously. As shown in the sequence of illustrations, the two airfoil blades have cross-sections which are increasingly different in size, shape, and orientation in the direction from section 1 to section 11, i.e., from tip to root. Said differently, the region of greatest difference between the exemplary airfoil blade and the conventional airfoil blade is near the hub consistent with the largest difference in loading distribution.

It may be desirable to utilize the technologies described herein in combination with those described in the above referenced related applications.

In addition to configurations suited for use with a conventional aircraft platform intended for horizontal flight, the technology described herein could also be employed for helicopter and tilt rotor applications and other lifting devices, as well as hovering devices.

Other potential configurations include those designed to extract energy from an air stream and produce useful torque, such as windmills which utilize torque generated by extracting energy from the air moving past their location to drive generators and produce electricity. Such configurations may include upstream counter swirl vanes.

The technology described herein is particularly beneficial for aircraft that cruise with shaft power per unit annulus area of above 20 SHP/ft2 (shaft horsepower per square foot) where the swirl losses can become significant. Loadings of 20 SHP/ft2 and above permit aircraft to cruise at Mach numbers above 0.6 Mach number without requiring excessively large propeller areas to limit swirl losses. One of the major benefits of embodiments of the invention is its ability to achieve high shaft power per unit annulus area without significant swirl loss penalties and this opens the opportunity to cruise at Mach numbers of 0.8 and above.

The exemplary embodiment discloses a propeller assembly for a propulsion system. The propeller assembly comprises a plurality of propeller blades each having a blade root proximal to an axis of rotation, a blade tip remote from the axis, and a blade span measured between the blade root and the blade tip. The propeller assembly has a load distribution such that at any location between the blade root and 30% span the value of ΔRCu is greater than or equal to 60% of the peak ΔRCu, and, in an embodiment, at 30% span the value of ΔRCu is greater than or equal to 70% of the peak ΔRCu.

The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.

The patentable scope of the invention is defined by the claims, and may include other examples that occur to those skilled in the art.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention

This invention relates to gas turbine engines and, particularly, to the engine's exhaust case frame in the gas path.

2. Related Art

As is generally well known, gas turbine engines are continually undergoing changes with goals of improving performance, decreasing vibration and noise for a given load rating, while reducing cost and enhancing durability, producability and repairability. To improve performance, it is typical to increase the operating temperature of the engine since increased turbine temperatures improves the engine's efficiency and thus its performance. Of course, these increased temperatures necessitate other changes in the engine to handle the increased thermals so as to maintain structural integrity of the engine's components.

As is known, the durability of the turbine exhaust case and its struts that are disposed in the gas path dependent on the material selected if not shielded in some way. For this reason, in new turbines it is not uncommon to shield the struts by encapsulating them with an aerodynamic fairing. The cross-section of an exhaust strut shield resembles an airplane wing with a rounded leading edge tapering off to a near knife edge at the trailing lip. These “wing sections” are set at a fixed angle, in the axial direction of the rotor shaft.

The angle of attack or impingement of the exhaust flow at the location of the strut shields is not constant. The changing angle of attack creates vortex shedding vibrations as it passes over the exhaust strut shields. Extensive cracking has been observed in the exhaust diffusers of some combustion turbine units, which is likely due to excessive vibration from the transient affects of vortex shedding off the strut shields.

Accordingly, improved performance of the engine could be obtained if vortex shedding off the strut shields were reduced and preferably eliminated. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved fairing shield for the exhaust struts that minimizes vortex shedding.

It is a further object of this invention to provide such an improved strut fairing design that minimizes vortex shedding at all engine speeds.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The foregoing objects are achieved employing a gas turbine engine including a turbine exhaust case having a pair of concentrically-spaced rings and a plurality of extending, elongated struts interconnected and supported by the rings. The struts are supported downstream of a last row of rotating turbine blades. A fairing encapsulates at least one of the struts. The fairing is designed in the shape of an airfoil having a substantially rounded upstream end that tapers in the downstream direction to a more narrow profile than the upstream end when viewed from the corresponding edge. The airfoil is constructed to have an upstream, stationary, annular housing which substantially surrounds the strut within the annular portion thereof. The airfoil also has a downstream tail section substantially situated downstream of the strut and pivotal about an axis parallel to the elongated dimension of the strut. Means are included for changing the angle of the tail section of the fairing about its pivot axis, preferably while the engine is operating, to minimize vortex shedding.

Preferably, a control system is provided that changes the angle of the tail section of the fairing on-line in response to changes in engine parameters such as speed or vibration to minimize the vibration in the exhaust section of the engine. The tail sections of the fairings can be controlled to move individually or preferably they can be interconnected to move as a single unit so all the tail sections of the fairings are moved at the same time and are at the same angle to the upstream stationary fairing sections. In this way, vortex shedding can be minimized and engine vibration reduced.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
The preferred embodiments of the invention provide an exhaust strut shield having a tail section that can rotate to change the angle of impingement of the exhaust gas to reduce vortex shedding. Proper control of the angle of the tail section will thus minimize vibration and damage to the engine and thus reduce maintenance expense. The present invention is best appreciated through a brief description of the environment within a combustion turbine in which the exhaust case of this invention is employed.

FIG. 1 illustrates a combustion turbine 10. The combustion turbine 10 includes a compressor 12, at least one combustor 14, and a turbine section 16. Typically, a plurality of combustors 14 are provided in a circular arc around the turbine shaft. The turbine section 16 includes a plurality of rotating blades 18 secured to a rotatable central shaft 20. A plurality of stationary vanes 22 are positioned upstream of the rotating blades 18, and are secured to a turbine cylinder 23. The vanes 22 are dimensioned and configured to guide the working gas over the blades 18.

In operation, air is drawn in through the compressor 12, where it is compressed and driven towards the combustor 14. The compressed air enters the combustor through an air intake 26. From the air intake 26, the air will typically enter the combustor at a combustor entrance 28, where it is mixed with fuel. The combustor 14 ignites the fuel/air mixture, thereby forming a working gas. The working gas is created typically at a temperature approximately equal to 2,500° F. to 2,900° F. (1,371° C.-1,593° C.). The gas expands through a transition member 30 and through the turbine 16, being guided by the vanes 22 to drive the rotating blades 18. As the gas passes through the turbine 16, it rotates the blades 18 which, in turn, drive the shaft 20, thereby transmitting usable mechanical work through the shaft 20. The combustion turbine 10 also includes a cooling system 24 dimensioned and configured to supply a coolant, for example, steam or compressed air, to internally cool the blades 18 and vanes 22 and other turbine components.

The exhaust case of this invention is positioned downstream of the last row of rotating blade 18 shown in FIG. 1. A perspective view of a partial section of the exhaust case of this invention is illustrated in FIG. 2, which shows a pair of spaced rings (diffusers) 32 and 34 concentrically supported by a plurality of extending fairings 36. The extending fairings interconnect and support the rings 32 and 34 downstream of the last row of rotating blades 18.

FIG. 2A shows a schematic rear view of the exhaust case of this invention from which it can be better appreciated that the fairings 36 can extend tangentially or radially from the inner ring 34 to the outward ring 32 where they are welded at each end to the corresponding ring. It should be appreciated that alternate means of attachment of the fairings to the rings can be employed, e.g., bolting. The struts 38 actually extend through the rings 32 and 34 and are connected at the outward ends to the turbine cylinder 23 and at the inward ends to the bearing housing that rotatably supports the turbine shaft 20. FIG. 2B shows an alternate embodiment in which the fairings 36 extend radially.

A top sectional view of the strut 38 and fairing 36 taken along a line just below the top ring 32 is illustrated in FIG. 3. The stationary portion 40 of the fairing 36 is shown completely surrounding the strut 38, though it should be appreciated that the trailing edge of the strut can be shielded by the moveable tail section 46 and need not be fully enclosed by the stationary portion of the fairing 40. The upstream end or male socket 44 of the moveable tail section 46 of the fairing 36 is rounded to mate with the female socket 42 in the downstream end of the stationary portion 40 of the fairing 36. The moveable tail section 46 pivots about pivot rod 48 as will be better appreciated from the description of FIGS. 4 and 5. The moveable tail section 46 narrows at its downstream end 52.

Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the fairing 36 is shown in perspective with a pivot pin 54 extending from its underside, which is captured in a corresponding hole in the inner ring 34 not shown. The pivot rod 48 is fixedly attached to and extends above the moveable tail section 46 through the outer ring 32, also not shown, and is connected to an actuator linkage 56. A force exerted on the actuator linkage 56 will cause the moveable tail section 46 to rotate about its pivot 48, 54. It should be appreciated that the pivot rod 48 can extend entirely through the moveable tail section 46 and terminate within the pivot pin 54 seat through the inner ring 34 or the pivot rod 48 can be a completely separate part from the pivot pin 54.

FIG. 6 illustrates that the pivot rod 48 extends through a bushing 60 where it is connected on the opposite side of the outer ring 32 to the actuator linkage 56 which couples the moveable tail section 46 to an actuator coupling 62. The actuator coupling 62 can be connected directly to a corresponding actuator, such as a remotely controlled hydraulic piston actuator, so that each moveable tail section 46 is operated individually. The actuator is supported between the outer ring 32 and the turbine housing 58, preferably by the turbine housing. Alternately, as shown in FIG. 7, a synchronizing ring 64 can be employed. The synchronizing ring 64 is positioned radially outward from and concentric to the outer ring or shroud 32. The operation of the synchronizing ring shown in FIG. 7 can better be appreciated from FIG. 10, which shows a front view of the turbine arrangement of FIG. 9 more fully described hereafter. The only difference between the turbine arrangement of FIG. 7 and that shown in FIG. 10 is that in the FIG. 10 arrangement, the upper pivot rods 48 extend through the turbine casing 58 and are connected to the synchronizing ring 64 which is supported outside and around the turbine casing 58. The distal end of a piston rod of a hydraulic actuator 66 is pivotably attached to one end of a drive link 68 by a pivot pin 72, while the other end of the drive link 68 is pivotably attached to the synchronizing ring 64 by a fastener 70. The cylinder of the actuator 66 can be supported by the turbine housing 58. Thus, one direction of movement of the piston of the actuator 66 rotates the synchronizing ring 64 in a first direction, which in turn rotates the tail section 46 of the fairing 36 in one direction. In the same manner, the other direction of movement of the piston of the actuating means 66 rotates the synchronizing ring 64 in the opposite direction and causes the tail section 46 of each fairing 36 to rotate in the opposite direction.

FIG. 8 illustrates a drive arrangement, which is a variation of that shown in FIG. 6, where each fairing tail section 46 is individually driven. In the arrangement shown in FIG. 8, the upper pivot rod 48 extends through the turbine housing and the actuator 62 is supported outside the turbine housing.

FIG. 9 illustrates a variation of the actuation arrangement shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 where the upper pivot rod 48 extends through the turbine housing and synchronizing ring 64 is positioned outside of the turbine. In all other respects, the arrangement shown in FIG. 9 functions the same as that shown in FIG. 7.

In operation, a sensor represented by block 74, shown in FIG. 10, will monitor a parameter of the turbine such as speed and/or vibration. When a predetermined incremental change in the vibration monitored is noted, then the control system 76 commands the hydraulic actuator to move the tail section 46 of the fairing 36 through a given arc, preferentially in incremental steps. The level of vibration at each of the incremental steps is noted and the hydraulic actuator is given the command to return the moveable tail section 46 back to the step exhibiting the lowest vibration. This process can be repeated every time there is an incremental change in the level of vibration above a predetermined value or the speed of the turbine is changed by more than a specified number. In this way, the angle of attack of the exhaust gases on the fairing tail section can be varied to minimize engine vibration resulting from vortex shedding and thus prevent the cracking that has been experienced in some engine exhaust diffusers.

Alternately, the control system can be programmed to move the tail section of a fairing a step in either direction, identify which step exhibits the least vibration and continue stepping in that direction until an increase in vibration is noted or a step limit is reached. The control system would then back off the moveable tail section one step. If, in taking the initial step, an increase in vibration is noted in each direction, then the control system would return the moveable fairing tail section to its initial position.

While specific embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, the particular embodiments disclosed are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the invention which is to be given the full breadth of the appended claims and any and all equivalents thereof.

FEDERAL RESEARCH STATEMENT
The US Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of Contract No. FA9300-04-C-0008 awarded by the United States Army.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to a small twin spool gas turbine engine, and more specifically to fan blade to rotor shaft connection of a gas turbine engine.

2. Description of the Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98

In a twin spool gas turbine engine, a low speed rotor shaft connects a low pressure turbine to the low pressure compressor which is typically a fan blade assembly. A high speed rotor shaft connects the high pressure turbine to the high pressure compressor. The high speed rotor shaft rotates around the inner low speed rotor shaft. Both rotor shafts are supported by bearings on the ends of the shafts.

In a small gas turbine engine, such as the size used to power an unmanned aero vehicle (UAV), the engine is so small that the rotor shafts will rotate at very high speeds. Also, to reduce the size of the engine the spacing between the forward and aft bearings is reduced to control the rotor dynamics problems that arise due to the high rotation speeds. The bearings that support the rotor shafts are thus exposed to very high temperatures and require cooling in order to make such a small engine possible.

At these high rotation speeds, the rotor shafts are also subject to high levels of vibration that must be addressed in the design to also make the small engine possible.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the present invention to provide for a small twin spool gas turbine engine less than 300 pounds of thrust.

It is another object of the present invention to provide for a small twin spool gas turbine engine that is compact in the axial direction in order to reduce the rotor dynamic effects.

It is another object of the present invention to provide for a small twin spool gas turbine engine in which the forward bearings are cooled to prevent overheating.

It is another object of the present invention to provide for a small twin spool gas turbine engine with a compressor fan assembly secured to the rotor shaft.

The present invention is a small twin spool gas turbine engine under the 300 pound thrust range in which the compressor fan assembly is secured to the low speed rotor shaft by a threaded nut that includes a plurality of axial extending cooling fluid passages in which the cooling fluid used to cool the forward end bearings can be discharged from the bearing cooling circuit of the engine. The forward bearings are cooled by passing a lubricant through the bearing cooling passage to prevent the bearings from overheating. The bearings are secured in place between the high pressure compressor rotor disk and the low pressure fan rotor disk with the threaded nut secured to the front end of the low speed rotor shaft.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS
FIG. 1 shows a cross section view of the forward end bearing assembly for the small twin spool gas turbine engine of the present invention.

FIG. 2 shows a cross section view of the twin spool gas turbine engine of the present invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is a bearing assembly and arrangement for a small twin spool gas turbine engine that allows for such a small engine to overcome the problems with rotor dynamics and cooling of the bearings. FIG. 1 shows the fan blade assembly which forms the low pressure compressor for the engine secured to the low speed rotor shaft. The fan blade assembly includes a fan rotor disk 11 with a plurality of fan blades 12 extending outward. A stator vane assembly is located immediately behind the fan blades and includes an inner shroud that forms a support surface for the bearings that support the inner and outer rotor shafts of the engine. The guide vane assembly includes an outer shroud 15 and an inner shroud 14 with a plurality of guide vanes 13 extending between the shrouds.

The low speed bearing 16 and the high speed bearing 17 are supported on the inner shroud 14 with at least one O-ring secured between the inner shroud 14 and the outer race of the bearing to provide damping for the rotor shafts. The high pressure compressor includes a forward extending portion 18 that abuts against the inner race of the high speed bearing 17. The inner race of the high speed bearing is secured onto an outer surface of the high speed rotor shaft 19 between a threaded nut 21 and forward extending portion 18.

The low speed bearing 16 is includes an outer race secured up against the underside of the inner shroud 14 and an inner race secured to an axial sleeve member 21 which is secured to the low speed inner rotor shaft 20. The axial sleeve abuts against the inner rotor shaft on the aft end, and includes a radial extending portion that abuts against the aft side of the inner race of the low speed bearing 16.

The two bearings 16 and 17 are also held in place by an annular wedge member 22 that abuts against the outer races of the bearings. The wedge member 22 is formed of two half circular annular pieces that, when placed together, form a full annular member around the bearing outer races.

The low speed bearing 16 is compressed between the fan rotor disk 11 and the axial sleeve 21 radial extending portion. The high speed bearing is compressed between the threaded nut 21 and the high pressure compressor rotor disk axial extension 18. The fan compressor 11 is secured onto the low speed rotor shaft 20 by a threaded nut 25 that includes one or more axial extending holes 26 that connect the aft side to the forward side of the threaded nut 25 to allow for the bearing lubricant fluid to pass out from the bearings. The threaded nut 25 compresses the fan rotor disk 11 against the inner race of the low speed bearing 16 to secure the fan assembly to the rotor shaft. In this embodiment, the cooling fluid passages 26 are shown as holes formed within the nut itself. In another embodiment, the passages could be slots or grooves formed on the inner surface of the nut such that the outer surface of the shaft and the inner surface of the nut define the passages.

A lubricant used to cool the bearing 16 and 17 is supplied to a location aft of the high speed bearing 17 and passes through the two bearings 16 and 17 in the direction toward the front end of the engine. In this embodiment, a lubricant supply tube 31 extends through the outer shroud 15 of the guide vane assembly, through the bypass channel in the engine, and into the inner shroud 14 of the guide vane assembly to open into the space behind the high speed bearing 17. The compressed air from the fan will leak from the bypass channel of the engine and flow through the bearings and carry the lubricant along for cooling the bearings. The axial sleeve 21 forms passages for the lubricant on the outer surface and the inner surface of the sleeve in which the cooling fluid can flow between the inner race of the low speed bearing 16 in a direction toward the turbine section, then in a radial inward direction toward the inner rotor shaft 11, and then back toward the front of the engine through a passage formed between the axial sleeve 21 and the outer surface of the low speed rotor shaft 20. This cooling passage provides additional cooling to the inner race of the low speed bearing.

An outer pin 27 secures the fan rotor disk 11 to the axial sleeve against relative rotation, and an inner pin 28 secures the axial sleeve to the low speed shaft 20 against relative rotation. Thus, the fan rotor disk 11 is secured to the inner rotor shaft 20 by the two pins 27 and 28 acting through the axial sleeve 21. The threaded nut 25 secures the fan rotor disk 11 to the inner rotor shaft 20 and the axial hole or holes 26 allow for the lubricant fluid to flow out from the bearing cooling passages that serpentines round the axial sleeve 21.

This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 353,112 filed 2/26/82.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to turbomachines and more particularly to an airfoil mounting assembly in a gas turbine engine.

While not limited thereto, this invention has particular utility when utilized in conjunction with a gas turbine engine having airfoils such as fan outlet guide vanes and stator vanes. Stator vanes, for example, each can typically include an integral mounting platform at the radially outer end thereof which is fastened to a cylindrical stator casing by retaining rings or by a plurality of mounting bolts. The vanes can have root portions of complex shapes such as the fir tree or dovetail type, which fit complementarily shaped slots in an inner stator supporting ring. Vanes having integral platforms and specifically shaped roots have been considered essential in the prior art to insure accurate alignment and positive retention of the vanes in the stator casing.

Furthermore, modern aircraft turbine engines are becoming shorter in length which requires closer spacing of the fan blades, stator vanes, and frame components. The resulting close proximity of and resulting aerodynamic interaction between the fan blades, stator vanes such as outlet guide vanes and the fan frame requires more than one type of vane in each vane row for achieving desired airflow thereacross. For example, individual vanes of the outlet guide vane row can include various airfoil cross-sections, and pitch, i.e., different airfoil angles of orientation with respect to the turbine radial axis for increasing aerodynamic performance.

The use of non-uniform type airfoils as above described in a turbomachine and the close proximity thereof to adjacent engine components has required a generally more complex mounting assembly in order to provide for the installation and removal of individual airfoils. Such a mounting assembly can include many parts and require accurate manufacturing, and thereby increase the complexity and cost of manufacture and assembly. For example, in order to reduce weight, the mounting members of the assembly are constructed relatively small and additional intravane fairing members are located between adjacent airfoil ends for providing a substantially uninterrupted outer flowpath surface for allowing the smooth flow of gases.

Additionally, turbomachine airfoils are subject to forced excitation at their natural frequencies of vibration which can result in undesirably high airfoil stresses. The stresses are more of a concern when the airfoil members are formed of composite materials. More specifically, the unidirectional strength characteristics of the filaments in an airfoil formed of composite materials adds to the complexity in providing conventional integral shrouds, either at the ends or at part span to mount the airfoil and to accommodate airfoil vibration as has been done with homogeneous metal airfoils.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved assembly for mounting airfoils in accurate alignment and with positive retention in a turbomachine.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an airfoil mounting assembly for mounting airfoils formed of composite materials.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an airfoil mounting assembly which allows the selective installation and removal of individual airfoils.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an airfoil mounting assembly which resiliently supports, and dampens vibration of, airfoils.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an airfoil mounting assembly which comprises a plurality of combination mounting and intravane fairing members defining a shroud having a substantially uninterrupted flow boundary surface for allowing the smooth flow of gases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Illustrated in FIG. 1 is a fan assembly region of an axial-flow, high-bypass gas turbine engine 10. The gas turbine, or turbofan, engine 10 includes a fan assembly enclosed within a substantially cylindrical stator outer casing 12. The fan assembly comprises a fan blade row including a plurality of circumferentially spaced and radially extending fan blades 11. The radially inner ends of the fan blades 11 are suitably connected to a rotatable shaft 13.

Disposed downstream of the plurality of fan blades 11 is an outlet guide vane row including a plurality of circumferentially spaced and radially extending outlet guide vanes 14. Although the vanes 14 can be made of aluminum and other metals, lightweight, high strength composite materials are preferred. More specifically, the composite materials can comprise high strength filaments, for example, boron or graphite filaments embedded in a homogeneous matrix, such as a plastic resin.

Each outlet guide vane 14 includes a radially inner end, or tip portion, 15 and a radially outer end, or root portion, 16. Although the outlet guide vanes 14 may include tip portions 15 and root portions 16 of complex shapes as found in the prior art, an improved airfoil mounting assembly according to one embodiment of the present invention includes plain ended vanes 14.

More specifically, each vane 14 comprises an elongate airfoil member having simply shaped, preferably airfoil shaped, tip and root portions 15 and 16 respectively, as shown more particularly on vane 14c of FIG. 2. Alternatively, and for example the tip portion 15 and root portion 16 can comprise other shapes such as rectangular. The tips 15 and roots 16 of vanes 14 are resiliently mounted to the inner surface of the stator casing 12 and an inner supporting shroud 17, respectively, suitably affixed in the engine 10 in a manner to be described below.

The stator casing 12 comprises an upstream end defining an annular fan inlet 18 and an intermediate section coaxially spaced about the inner shroud 17 and jointly cooperating therewith for defining an annular bypass duct or passageway 19. Disposed in bypass duct 19 and attached to stator casing 12 and inner shroud 17 are a plurality of circumferentially spaced strut or frame members 20.

In operation, ambient air is drawn through fan inlet 18 of the upstream end of the stator casing 12 and is accelerated by the fan blades 11, a portion of which air flows between and around outlet guide vanes 14 and through bypass duct 19. For increasing aerodynamic performance of the air passing through bypass duct 19 the outlet guide vanes 14 are disposed at non-uniform angular orientations with respect to each other.

More specifically, the angular orientation of the vanes 14 with respect to respective engine radial axes extending therethrough and to the airflow streamlines of the fan air flowing through bypass duct 19 can vary from vane to vane. Without the benefit of the present invention such non-uniformity of angular orientation of vanes 14 requires a non-uniform mounting assembly for each vane 14.

Furthermore, it is desirable that each vane 14 be easily and selectively installable in and removable from its position between the stator casing 12 and the inner shroud 17. The relatively close proximity of the fan blades 11, outlet guide vanes 14, and frame members 20 provides little area for maneuvering the vanes into and out of position and accordingly adds to the difficulty in providing such an accessible vane arrangement.

According to the present invention there is provided an airfoil mounting assembly which satisfies the above requirements as well as provides additional benefits from the use thereof as described below.

FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate in more detail an airfoil mounting assembly according to one embodiment of the present invention. An airfoil mounting assembly including a plurality of arcuate mounting fairings disposed circumferentially adjacently to each other, connects adjacent outlet guide vanes 14 and stator casing 12.

More specifically, the mounting fairings can comprise and be arranged in complementary pairs including a first, radially inner, mounting fairing 21 and a second, radially outer, mounting fairing 22. The mounting fairings 21 and 22 each includes a central boss 23 having oppositely, radially extending first and second ends and at least one elongate recess 24 disposed in the first, radially inner end. The recess 24 preferably extends substantially radially, i.e., perpendicularly inwardly from the lower or inner surface of the boss 23 and substantially parallel to an engine radial axis. The recess 24, as most particularly shown in conjunction with the mounting fairing 21 of vane 14c extends longitudinally in boss 23, and generally parallel to the engine longitudinal centerline, and defines a well corresponding generally to the cross-sectional configuration of an airfoil for receiving the root 16 of vane 14c.

The first mounting fairing 21 further includes first and second ledges or flanges 25 and 26, respectively, which extend circumferentially outwardly from opposite sides of substantially the radially inwardly facing or lower portion of the boss 23. The flanges 25 and 26 and the boss 23 generally define an inverted T-like lateral profile when viewed along the engine longitudinal centerline, with each flange 25 and 26 defining one element of a lap joint pair. The first flange 25, the second flange 26 and the boss 23 cooperate to define a preferably arcuate mounting fairing having a continuous, concave, radially inwardly facing lower or inner surface 27. However, a suitable non-arcuate mounting fairing could be used.

Flanges 25 and 26 of the mounting fairing 21 are relatively thin in the radial or transverse dimension for reducing mounting fairing weight. In order to provide adequate structural strength, a plurality of integral, reinforcing gussets 28 extend from the upper surfaces of the first and second flanges 25 and 26 and from the sides of boss 23. The gussets 28 define therebetween a plurality of substantially triangular, weight-reducing pockets 29.

Symmetrically disposed on opposite sides of the boss 23 and integral with the first and second flanges 25 and 26 are fastening bosses 30 and 31, respectively, for receiving mounting bolts. The fastening bosses 30 and 31 have transversely or radially extending apertures therein, which can contain suitable bushings and which recessively receive mounting bolts. The apertures in the bosses 30 and 31 have axes which along with the radial axis of the recess 24 preferably intersect at substantially a common point along the engine longitudinal centerline. The fastening bosses 30 and 31 are transversely disposed in the flanges 25 and 26 and can extend upwardly from the lower surface 27 of the first mounting fairing 21 approximately one-half the transverse thickness of boss 23 as shown more particularly in FIG. 3.

The second mounting fairing 22 is generally similar in construction to that of the first mounting fairing 21. However, it includes first and second ledges or flanges 32 and 33, respectively, which extend circumferentially outwardly from opposite sides of substantially the radially outwardly facing or upper portion of the boss 23 thereof. The first and second flanges 32 and 33 and the boss 23 generally define a T-like lateral profile when viewed along the engine longitudinal centerline. Each first and second flange 32 and 33 of the second mounting fairings 22 overlaps radially the second and first flanges 26 and 25, respectively, of adjacent first mounting fairings 21 and defines the second element of the lap joint pair.

The first flange 32, the second flange 33 and the boss 23 cooperate to define a preferably arcuate mounting fairing having a concave, radially inwardly facing inner or lower surface 34. However, a suitable non-arcuate mounting fairing could be used. Flanges 32 and 33 also are relatively thin in the radial or transverse dimension for reducing the mounting fairing weight. A plurality of integral reinforcing gussets 35 extend from the upper surfaces of the first and second flanges 32 and 33 and from the sides of boss 23. The gussets 35 define therebetween a plurality of substantially triangular weight-reducing pockets 36.

Symmetrically disposed on opposite sides of the boss 23 and integral with the first and second flanges 32 and 33 are fastening bosses 37 and 38, respectively for receiving mounting bolts. The fastening bosses 37 and 38 have transversely or radially extending apertures therein, which also can contain suitable bushings for receiving mounting bolts and have axes which along with the radial axis of the recess 24 preferably intersect at substantially a common point along the engine longutidinal centerline. The fastening bosses 37 and 38 are transversely disposed in the flanges 32 and 33 and can extend downwardly from the upper or radially outer surface of the second mounting fairing 22 approximately one-half the transverse thickness of boss 23 thereof as shown more particularly in FIG. 3.

Although the roots 16 of vanes 14 can be rigidly secured directly in the recesses 24 of the mounting fairings 21 and 22, it is preferred that the mounting fairings 21 and 22 further comprise elastomeric receiving means such as an elastomeric boot, or closed bottom insert, 39 in the recesses 24 for resiliently supporting the roots 16 of the vanes 14. In this manner, the mounting fairings can be designed structurally rigid to withstand any resulting loads acting thereon from the vanes 14; with the elastomeric boot 39 providing for a structurally soft, resilient mount which can additionally dampen any vibrations of the vanes 14.

Suitable materials for the boots 39 can include, for example, polyester urethane. However, a fluoroelastomer such as is sold under the trademark Viton (E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co.) is preferred because its material properties do not appreciably lessen at the elevated temperatures experienced during operation.

The mounting fairings 21 and 22 can be made of metals such as aluminum, or pressure molded using polysulfone, or polyamide-imide such as is sold under the trademark Torlon (Amoco Chemicals Corp.). However, a molded mounting fairing comprising chopped graphite-fiber reinforced nylon is preferred because it provides relatively high structural strength with reduced weight.

The bushings found in the fastening bosses 30, 31, 37 and 38 can comprise either structurally hard or soft materials for either rigidly or elastically supporting the mounting fairings 21 and 22, respectively. However, for mounting fairings 21 and 22 comprising non-metals such as chopped graphite-fiber reinforced nylon, a metal bushing, such as aluminum is preferred.

The recesses 24 can be made sufficiently large for accommodating a family of vane roots 16 having various cross-sections and angular orientations. In this manner, the first and second mounting fairings 21 and 22 can each be made to a uniform construction and only the boots 39 need be individually tailored to conform to the various vane roots 16. The boots 39 can be simply individually molded for accommodating the various roots 16 in the recesses 24 of the mounting fairings.

A respective mounting fairing 21 or 22, boot 39, and vane 14 comprise an assembly unit which can be assembled and an adhesive, such as epoxy, can be used for bonding the boot 39 to the root 16 of vane 14 and into recess 24. Alternatively, the root 16 of vane 14 can be positioned in the recess 24 of a respective mounting fairing 21 or 22 and the boot 39 can be molded and cured in place, with the boot 39 material acting as the adhesive for joining the boot to the root 16 of vane 14 and to the walls of the recess 24.

In order to assemble the outlet guide vanes 14 into the turbofan engine 10, the roots 16 of vanes 14 are assembled to respective first and second mounting fairings as above-described. As more particularly shown in FIG. 2 and in conjunction with vane 14c shown in an exploded view, a vane 14 having a first mounting fairing 21 secured thereto is positioned in the turbine 10 with the tip 15 placed in an elastomeric boot 40. The boot 40 is similar in construction and composition to boot 39 and includes a recess which is complementary shaped to and for tightly receiving tip 15. Each boot 40 is suitably secured in a respective one of a plurality of radially extending slots 41 in the inner shroud 17. A vane 14 with a second mounting fairing 22 secured to the root 16 thereof, vane 14d shown in an intermediate position between an installed and removed position, can then be positioned in the turbine 10 with the tip 15 positioned in a boot 40 (not shown) in the slot 41 in inner shroud 17.

As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, tubular spacers 42 are positioned between the upper surface of the second mounting fairings 22 and the stator casing 12 and aligned with the apertures in fastening bosses 37 and 38 of the first and second flanges 32 and 33, respectively, and with apertures 43 which extend through stator casing 12, all of which elements and apertures are preferably aligned along respective common radial axes.

The first mounting fairings 21 are positioned against the inner surfaces of the second mounting fairings 22 such that the first and second flanges of adjacent mounting fairings overlap radially. More specifically, the outer surfaces of bosses 30 and 31 of the first mounting fairings 21 are placed against the inner surfaces of the second and first flanges 33 and 32 of the adjacent second mounting fairings 22, respectively, and define lap joints thereat.

Mounting bolts 44 extend through respective first and second flanges of adjacent mounting fairings and through spacers 42 and apertures 43 in stator casing 12 and are suitably secured, by a nut for example, to stator casing 12. The heads of the bolts 44 are suitably recessed in the inner surfaces of the bosses 30 and 31 of the first mounting fairings 21. Although each mounting fairing is held by two bolts, the bolts additionally support adjacent mounting fairings resulting in an efficient mounting assembly requiring effectively only one bolt per mounting fairing.

When the mounting fairings 21 and 22 are assembled to each other, the lap joint arrangement of the first and second flanges thereof are effective for providing a substantially continuous and segmented, cylindrical, outer shroud joining the vanes 14. Furthermore, the inner surfaces 27 and 34 of the first and second mounting fairings 21 and 22, respectively, are circumferentially aligned at a common radius from the engine longitudinal centerline and define a substantially uninterrupted and aerodynamically smooth, straight cylindrical flowpath or fairing surface. Such a fairing surface reduces the leakage of airflow radially outwardly between vanes 14 and allows the smooth flow of gases in the axial direction.

As more particularly shown in FIG. 2, the removal of any individual vane 14 from the outlet guide vane row is simply accomplished by removing the two bolts 44 extending through the appropriate mounting fairing and tilting the vane assembly out. More specifically, in the case of removing a first mounting fairing and vane unit, vane 14c for example, the unit can be lowered radially from its position inasmuch as the tip 15 of vane 14 can slide radially in recess 41 of inner shroud 17. A second mounting fairing and vane unit, vane 14d for example, is individually removable after the spacers 42 are removed which allows the fairing and vane unit to be firstly rotated axially and secondly rotated or lifted radially up and out of the outlet guide vane row.

The use of elastomeric boots 39 and 40 results in a resilient or elastic mounting which provides substantially a simple support rather than a fixed support to the outer ends, i.e. tip and root, of vanes 14. This simple support type arrangement reduces aerodynamically induced vane stresses at the outer supported ends of the vane. The reduction of stress at the outer supported ends of the vanes 14 is a major consideration for the successful mounting of composite vanes of the type as above-described. Additionally, the use of elastomeric boots 39 and 40 inherently provides effective damping for any vibration of the vanes 14 that may occur. Furthermore, the resilient mounting of vanes 14 can reduce foreign object damage of the vanes 14 that may otherwise result.

Another embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 4. A plurality of mounting fairings 45 secure the radially outer ends of the vanes 14 to the stator casing 12. Each mounting fairing 45 is generally similar in construction and material to the first mounting fairing 21 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. However, in this embodiment all the mounting fairings 45 have substantially the same dimensions and are disposed adjacent to each other without any radial overlap of adjacent flanges. As in the first embodiment, the boots 39 can be individually molded for accomodating any non-uniform angular orientation of the vanes 14 in the recesses 24.

It will be observed that without the overlapping of adjacent mounting fairings, two bolts 44 for each mounting fairing are required for mounting the vane 14 to the stator casing 12. This is in contrast to having one bolt 44 per vane as in the first embodiment. However, all the advantages and benefits otherwise resulting from the invention as described for the first embodiment are realizable.

While there has been described herein what is considered to be a preferred embodiment of the invention, other modifications will occur to those skilled in the art after having considered the present disclosure. For example, the mounting fairings 21 and 22 can each comprise a boss or a plurality of bosses 23 having a plurality of recesses 24 therein circumferentially spaced for receiving a plurality of vane roots. In this manner, vanes 14 can be mounted and assembled in groups which can simplify assembly and disassembly as well as improve the vibrational characteristics of the grouped vanes by increasing vibratory natural frequencies.

The mounting fairings can alternatively be designed for mounting the radially inner ends of the vanes 14 if desired.

The boots 39 and 40 can alternatively be open-ended bushings which are bonded in recesses 24 and 41 which recesses can comprise apertures extending through the bosses 23 and shroud 17, respectively. Additionally, the first and second flanges of the mounting fairings can comprise flanges arranged axially side-by-side for creating lap joints which overlap in an axial plane and being suitably joined.

Although the airfoil mounting assembly mounts outlet guide vanes in a gas turbine engine, the arrangement can be used for mounting any stator vanes to the stator casing in a gas turbine engine.

The airfoil mounting assembly can comprise a rotatable outer shroud for interconnecting the tips of rotating blades in an engine. In this embodiment, the mounting bolts 44 need only connect the first, or leading end, flange and the second, or trailing end, flange of adjacent mounting fairings and not be attached to the stator outer casing 12, so as to allow the rotor wheel and blades to freely rotate.

Accordingly, it is desired to secure by the appended claims all modifications falling within the true spirit and scope of the invention.

MECHANISM FOR DRIVING BLADE ORIENTATION ADJUSTING MEMBERS

Technical field

The invention relates to a mechanism for driving adjusting members adjusting the orientation of the blades of several rectifier vanes of a turbomachine.

The invention more particularly relates to a drive mechanism for several adjusting members enabling the adjusting members to be driven simultaneously with displacement speeds differing from one adjusting member to another.

Prior art

The compressor and/or the turbine of a turbomachine are formed from several vanes, each vane comprising a gas flow rectifier.

The orientation of the rectifier blades is known to be modified as a function of the operating conditions of the turbomachine in order to optimise the latter's yield.

According to one known embodiment, the modification of the orientation of the rectifier blades is controlled via an actuator including a drive shaft that engages with a member associated with each blade, or a blade orientation control unit.

Although the use of a single shaft for driving the blades of two rectifier vanes helps limit the number of components in the turbomachine, this system has particularly large dimensions, which means that this solution is preferred for large-scale turbomachines.

The use of a control unit can be adapted to suit all turbomachine sizes. However, this solution involves a large number of components, which reduces system accuracy due to the cumulated gaps between the many components and their respective deformations. The purpose of the invention is to propose a mechanism for driving blade orientation adjusting members that has reduced dimensions and that comprises a reduced number of parts.

Description of the invention

The invention concerns a drive mechanism for driving at least two adjusting members, each adjusting member being used to adjust the orientation of the blades of a turbomachine rectifier vane associated therewith, the drive mechanism comprising means for simultaneously driving the displacement of said at least two adjusting members in the turbomachine, characterised in that it comprises a single threaded rod and several levers, each lever being associated with an adjusting member, wherein a first part of each lever engages with the threaded rod and wherein one end of an arm of said lever is connected to the adjusting member associated therewith, so that the rotation of the threaded rod causes a simultaneous rotation of the levers associated with the adjusting members.

Preferably, the first part of each lever forms a cogwheel centred around the pivot axis A of the lever and which engages with the threaded rod.

Preferably, the threaded rod comprises a threaded portion, which is associated with each lever and with which the first part of the lever associated therewith engages.

Preferably, the pitch of the threaded portion that is associated with a lever is different from the pitch of the threaded portion that is associated with another lever.

Preferably, the pitch of a threaded portion is variable along the threaded rod.

Preferably, the dimensions of the first part and/or of the arm of a lever are different from the dimensions of the first part and/or of the arm respectively, of another lever.

Preferably, each adjusting member consists in a control ring that is mounted rotatably about the main axis of the turbomachine, and which is connected to said end of the arm of the lever associated therewith, via a control rod.

Preferably, the length of the control rod can be modified.

The invention further relates to an aircraft turbomachine comprising at least two rectifier vanes, wherein the orientation of the blades of each rectifier vane can be modified, characterised in that each rectifier vane comprises a member for adjusting the orientation of the blades of said rectifier vane, the adjusting members being capable of moving in rotation in the turbomachine around the main axis of the turbomachine and being driven in rotation by a drive mechanism according to the invention.

Brief description of the figures

Other characteristics and advantages of the invention shall be better understood upon reading the following detailed description given with reference to the appended figures, in which the single figure is a schematic representation of a drive mechanism according to the invention.

Detailed description of the specific embodiments

The single figure shows a mechanism 10 for driving adjusting members 12 for adjusting the orientation of the blades (not shown) of several turbomachine rectifier vanes.

Each of the adjusting members 12 consists in a ring associated with a rectifier vane of a turbomachine, which is capable of moving in rotation in the turbomachine about the main axis of the turbomachine (not shown). In this regard, the turbomachine comprises means connecting each ring 12 to the blades of the rectifier vane associated therewith, such that the rotation of the ring 12 results in the simultaneous modification of the orientation of each of the associated blades. For the purposes of illustration and in no way limiting the invention, these connection means comprise levers connecting each blade to the ring 12.

In this example, three adjusting members/rings 12 associated with three rectifier vanes are shown. It is understood that the invention is not limited to this number of rectifier vanes and rings 12, as the drive mechanism 10 can concern only two rings 12 associated with two rectifier vanes or more.

Therefore, the rotation of a ring 12 in the turbomachine causes the simultaneous rotation of all blades of the rectifier vane associated therewith.

When changing the operating conditions of the turbomachine, the orientation of the blades of all rectifier vanes must be simultaneously modified in order to optimise the turbomachine's performance. Moreover, the blades of each rectifier vane rotate by an angle that differs in relation to the angle of rotation of the blades of the other rectifier vanes.

The drive mechanism 10 for the adjusting rings 12 is designed for simultaneously driving the movement of the two rings 12 and so that the magnitude of the displacement of the rings 12 differs from one ring to the others.

In order to simultaneously drive the adjusting rings 12, the drive mechanism comprises a single threaded rod 14 which is associated with all of the adjusting members 12 and a coupling system 16 connecting each adjusting member 12 to the threaded rod 14.

Each coupling system 16 comprises a lever 18 that is rotatably mounted in a control unit 20 common to all of the coupling systems 16 and that is coupled to the threaded rod 14, and a control rod 22 connecting the lever 18 to the adjusting ring 12 associated with the coupling system.

The lever 18 comprises a first part 24 that engages with a threaded portion 26 of the threaded rod 14 associated therewith, and which consists in this case of a cogwheel centred around the hinge axis A of the lever 18 in relation to the control unit 20. The toothing of this cogwheel 24 is complementary to the threaded portion 26 associated therewith.

The lever 18 further comprises an arm 28 that crosses the control unit 20, and wherein the end 30 of the arm 28 that exits the control unit 20 is connected to the control rod 22.

A first end 22a of the control rod 22 is connected to the free end 30 of the arm 28 by a standard hinge, the second end 22b of the control rod 22 is connected to the adjusting ring 12 via a bracket 32 supported by the associated adjusting ring 12.

Preferably, the control rod 22 consists in a stretching screw, the length of which can be adjusted by turning its central body 34 about the main axis of the control rod 22.

When the threaded rod 14 rotates about its main axis, being driven by an electric motor 36, the lever 18 rotates about its main axis A. The lever 18 thus exerts a traction or pushing force on the control rod 22, which in turn drives the associated adjusting ring 12 in rotation about the main axis of the turbomachine.

As previously stipulated, the coupling systems 16 are all connected to the threaded rod 14. Therefore, when the threaded rod 14 rotates about its main axis, the coupling systems 16 drive all the adjusting rings 12 in rotation simultaneously.

The blade orientation adjustment thus takes place at the same time, however the rotational magnitude of the blades of one rectifier vane is generally different from the rotational magnitude of the blades of another rectifier vane.

For this purpose, the dimensions of the lever 18 of a coupling system 16 are different from the dimensions of the lever 18 of another coupling system 16.

In particular, the diameter of the cogwheel 24 of one lever 18 is different from the diameter of the cogwheel of another lever 18.

Therefore, the length of the arm 28 of one lever is different from the length of the arm 28 of another lever 18.

It is understood that the differences between the diameters of the cogwheels 24 or between the lengths of the levers 28 can be applied simultaneously or separately from one lever to another, according to the difference in the rotational magnitude from one ring 12 to another.

Therefore, in order to obtain different rotational magnitudes between two rings 12, the threaded portions 26 of the threaded rod 14 can be adapted.

For this purpose, according to a first embodiment, the pitch of a threaded portion 26 is different from the pitch of another threaded portion 26. The pitch variation of the threaded portion 26 can be continuous or discontinuous, i.e. the pitch of a section of the threaded portion is continuous and the pitch of another section of the threaded portion is different from the pitch of the first section.

According to another embodiment, the pitch of a threaded portion 26 is variable along the threaded rod 14. Therefore, when the threaded rod 14 rotates about its main axis, the pitch of the threaded portion 26, with which the first part 24 of the lever 18 engages, changes.

This provides for a non-linear control, or a control that is not proportional to the movement of a ring 12. Moreover, this non-linearity between the different rings 12 is directly managed at the level of the control rod and the levers. The drive mechanism 10 therefore does not require any additional workpiece to perform this function.

The first part 24 of the lever 18 that is associated with a threaded portion 26 is formed in a complementary manner to said threaded portion, i.e. the pitch of this cogwheel is identical to the pitch of the threaded portion 26 and said pitch is, where applicable, also variable as a function of the angular position of the first part 24 of the lever 18 about its pivot axis A. Such a drive mechanism 10 comprises a main rod for driving the adjusting members 12, which is capable of moving in rotation about its main axis. The rod therefore undergoes no additional travel, which would require providing it with additional volume in the turbomachine.

Therefore, the turbomachine comprising such a mechanism for driving adjusting members adjusting the orientation of the blades of the rectifier vanes, therefore benefits from optimised dimensions.

FIELD
[0001]
The present disclosure relates to gas turbine engines, and more specifically, to a turbine section of a gas turbine engine.
BACKGROUND
[0002]
A gas turbine engine typically includes a fan section, a compressor section, a combustor section, and a turbine section. A fan section may drive air along a bypass flowpath while a compressor section may drive air along a core flowpath. In general, during operation, air is pressurized in the compressor section and is mixed with fuel and burned in the combustor section to generate hot combustion gases. The hot combustion gases flow through the turbine section, which extracts energy from the hot combustion gases to power the compressor section and other gas turbine engine loads.
[0003]
The efficiency of the engine can be increased by passing a higher temperature gas flow through the turbine. However, the turbine inlet temperature is limited by the vane and blade (airfoils) material properties and the cooling capabilities of these airfoils. For example, first stage vanes that are located downstream from the combustor may be susceptible to excessive oxidation due to the high temperature of the combustion gases leaving the combustor section.

A more complete understanding of the present disclosure, however, may best be obtained by referring to the detailed description and claims when considered in connection with the drawing figures.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0020]
The detailed description of exemplary embodiments herein makes reference to the accompanying drawings, which show exemplary embodiments by way of illustration. While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the disclosure, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that logical changes and adaptations in design and construction may be made in accordance with this disclosure and the teachings herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Thus, the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation.
[0021]
As used herein, “aft” refers to the direction associated with the exhaust (e.g., the back end) of a gas turbine engine. As used herein, “forward” refers to the direction associated with the intake (e.g., the front end) of a gas turbine engine.
[0022]
A first component that is “axially outward” of a second component means that a first component is positioned at a greater distance in the aft or forward direction away from the longitudinal center of the gas turbine along the longitudinal axis of the gas turbine, than the second component. A first component that is “axially inward” of a second component means that the first component is positioned closer to the longitudinal center of the gas turbine along the longitudinal axis of the gas turbine, than the second component.
[0023]
A first component that is “radially outward” of a second component means that the first component is positioned at a greater distance away from the engine central longitudinal axis than the second component. A first component that is “radially inward” of a second component means that the first component is positioned closer to the engine central longitudinal axis than the second component. In the case of components that rotate circumferentially about the engine central longitudinal axis, a first component that is radially inward of a second component rotates through a circumferentially shorter path than the second component. The terminology “radially outward” and “radially inward” may also be used relative to references other than the engine central longitudinal axis. For example, a first component of a combustor that is radially inward or radially outward of a second component of a combustor is positioned relative to the central longitudinal axis of the combustor.
[0024]
In various embodiments and with reference to FIG. 1, a gas turbine engine 20 is provided. Gas turbine engine 20 may be a two-spool turbofan that generally incorporates a fan section 22, a compressor section 24, a combustor section 26 and a turbine section 28. Alternative engines may include, for example, an augmentor section among other systems or features. In operation, fan section 22 can drive coolant (e.g., air) along a bypass flow-path B while compressor section 24 can drive coolant along a core flow-path C for compression and communication into combustor section 26 then expansion through turbine section 28. Although depicted as a turbofan gas turbine engine 20 herein, it should be understood that the concepts described herein are not limited to use with turbofans as the teachings may be applied to other types of turbine engines including three-spool architectures.
[0025]
Gas turbine engine 20 may generally comprise a low speed spool 30 and a high speed spool 32 mounted for rotation about an engine central longitudinal axis A-A′ relative to an engine static structure 36 or engine case via several bearing systems 38, 38-1, and 38-2. Engine central longitudinal axis A-A′ is oriented in the z direction on the provided xyz axis. It should be understood that various bearing systems 38 at various locations may alternatively or additionally be provided, including for example, bearing system 38, bearing system 38-1, and bearing system 38-2.
[0026]
Low speed spool 30 may generally comprise an inner shaft 40 that interconnects a fan 42, a low pressure compressor 44 and a low pressure turbine 46. Inner shaft 40 may be connected to fan 42 through a geared architecture 48 that can drive fan 42 at a lower speed than low speed spool 30. Geared architecture 48 may comprise a gear assembly 60 enclosed within a gear housing 62. Gear assembly 60 couples inner shaft 40 to a rotating fan structure. High speed spool 32 may comprise an outer shaft 50 that interconnects a high pressure compressor 52 and high pressure turbine 54. A combustor 56 may be located between high pressure compressor 52 and high pressure turbine 54. A mid-turbine frame 57 of engine static structure 36 may be located generally between high pressure turbine 54 and low pressure turbine 46. Mid-turbine frame 57 may support one or more bearing systems 38 in turbine section 28. Inner shaft 40 and outer shaft 50 may be concentric and rotate via bearing systems 38 about the engine central longitudinal axis A-A′, which is collinear with their longitudinal axes. As used herein, a “high pressure” compressor or turbine experiences a higher pressure than a corresponding “low pressure” compressor or turbine.
[0027]
The core airflow C may be compressed by low pressure compressor 44 then high pressure compressor 52, mixed and burned with fuel in combustor 56, then expanded over high pressure turbine 54 and low pressure turbine 46. Turbines 46, 54 rotationally drive the respective low speed spool 30 and high speed spool 32 in response to the expansion.
[0028]
In various embodiments, geared architecture 48 may be an epicyclic gear train, such as a star gear system (i.e., a sun gear in meshing engagement with a plurality of star gears supported by a carrier and in meshing engagement with a ring gear) or other gear system. Geared architecture 48 may have a gear reduction ratio of greater than about 2.3 and low pressure turbine 46 may have a pressure ratio that is greater than about five (5). In various embodiments, the bypass ratio of gas turbine engine 20 is greater than about ten (10:1). In various embodiments, the diameter of fan 42 may be significantly larger than that of the low pressure compressor 44, and the low pressure turbine 46 may have a pressure ratio that is greater than about five (5:1). Low pressure turbine 46 pressure ratio may be measured prior to inlet of low pressure turbine 46 as related to the pressure at the outlet of low pressure turbine 46 prior to an exhaust nozzle. It should be understood, however, that the above parameters are exemplary of various embodiments of a suitable geared architecture engine and that the present disclosure contemplates other gas turbine engines including direct drive turbofans. A gas turbine engine may comprise an industrial gas turbine (IGT) or a geared aircraft engine, such as a geared turbofan, or non-geared aircraft engine, such as a turbofan, or may comprise any gas turbine engine as desired.
[0029]
As mentioned above, hot combustion gases from the combustor can potentially deteriorate the mechanical integrity and diminish the lifecycle of downstream turbine components. These negative effects may be especially true for conventionally static turbine components (e.g., stators), such as vanes, vane supports, blade outer air seals (“BOAS”), and/or BOAS supports. That is, because the temperature of the hot combustion gases is not uniform and because such temperature non-uniformity produces discrete hot spots, conventionally static (i.e., non-rotating) hardware that is located downstream of and in fluid contact with the hot spots may be especially susceptible to oxidation and/or other deleterious temperature effects.
[0030]
Accordingly, the present disclosure provides, according to various embodiments, a gas turbine engine that has at least one traditionally static component that is rotatable. For example, a vane support, a vane stage, a BOAS support, and/or BOAS may be configured to rotate so that not just a single portion of the component is directly downstream of the hot spot. Such components are often annular structures that extend around the engine central longitudinal axis and thus, by rotating these traditionally static components, the higher temperature of the hot spot does not only affect a discrete portion of the component.
[0031]
In various embodiments, and with reference to FIG. 2, the turbine section 28 of the gas turbine engine 20 is provided. The turbine section 28 may include one or more vane stages 146 and one or more blade stages 136, 156. As used herein, the term “vane stage” refers to an annular array of vanes and the term “blade stage” refers to an annular array of blades. As mentioned below, the vane stage 146 may be formed of multiple arcuate sections or the vane stage 146 may be a unitary, hoop structure. In various embodiments the vane stage 146 is coupled to a vane support 142 and in various embodiments the blade stage(s) 136, 156 have a BOAS 134, 154 located radially outward from the blades. The BOAS may be coupled to a BOAS support 152.
[0032]
In various embodiments, rotation of at least one of the traditionally static components (e.g., the vane support 142, the vane stage 146, the BOAS support 152, and/or the BOAS 134, 154) may be passive. For example, the vane support 142 coupled to the vane stage 146 may be coupled to the turbine case 128 via bearings and the flow of hot combustions gases from the combustor may cause the vanes to rotate. The gas turbine engine may include various brakes and/or pins that restrain and/or limit the rotation of the vanes. In various embodiments, the rotation of at least one of the traditionally static components, such as the vane support 142 and the vane stage 146, may be accomplished using a drive system. The drive system, according to various embodiments, may include one or more drive units 160A, 160B, 160C, as described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 2, that actively and controllably rotate at least one of the traditionally static components about the engine central longitudinal axis. With a drive system, for example, each vane of the vane stage 146 may be configured to spend about the same amount of time directly downstream of the hot spots, thereby spreading the heat load across all of the vanes instead of concentrating the heat load from one of the hot spots on just one of the vanes. Additional details pertaining to rotation methods are included below.
[0033]
In various embodiments, and with reference to FIG. 3, one or more drive units 160A, 160B, 160C are provided for imparting rotation to the vane stage 146 via the vane support 142. While numerous details and examples are included herein pertaining to rotation of the vane stage 146 and vane support 142, such details may also be applicable to the BOAS support 152 and/or the BOAS 134, 154. Further, while numerous details are included herein pertaining to the drive system engaging the vane support 142, the drive system may be configured to directly engage the vane stage 146.
[0034]
In various embodiments, the drive unit(s) 160A, 160B, 160C include a drive motor 162A, 162B, 162C coupled to a drive gear 164A, 164B, 164C. The drive gear 164A, 164B, 164C may be configured to engage a complementary and circumferentially extending gear teeth track 141A, 141B, 141C disposed on a surface of the vane support 142. The drive motor 162A, 162B, 162C may be coupled to and controlled by a controller and may be configured to drive rotation of the drive gear 164A, 164B, 164C via a drive shaft 163A, 163B, 163C. With the drive gear 164A, 164B, 164C engaged with the complementary gear teeth track 141A, 141B, 141C, rotation of the drive gear 164A, 164B, 164C causes the gear teeth track 141A, 141B, 141C to circumferentially translate through the drive gear 164A, 164B, 164C, which results in rotation of the vane support 142 and vane stage 146.
[0035]
As described in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. 3 and 5, the drive unit of the drive system may be mounted to stationary component such as the turbine case 128, such as a radially outward surface of the turbine case 128, and the drive shaft 163A, 163B, 163C may extend through/across the turbine case 128. In various embodiments, bearings 161A, 161B, 161C may be disposed around the drive shaft 163A, 163B, 163C. Additional bearings, such as a bearing track 121, may be disposed between the vane support 142 and the turbine case 128, thereby allowing relative rotation between the turbine case 128 (static) and the vane support 142 and vane stage 146.
[0036]
In various embodiments, the gear teeth track 141A may be located and disposed on a forward facing surface of the vane support 142. In various embodiments, the gear teeth track 141B, 141C may be disposed on an aft facing surface of the vane support 142. In various embodiments, and with brief reference to FIG. 5, the gear teeth track 541 may be disposed on a radially outward surface of the vane support 142. The gear teeth track may be disposed on the BOAS 134, 154, the BOAS support 152, and/or directly on the vanes/vane stage 146.
[0037]
The various components of the turbine section 28, such as the vane support 142, the BOAS support 152, the BOAS 134, 154, and the vane stage 146, may be annular, hoop-like structures that that extend circumferentially around the engine central longitudinal axis of the gas turbine engine. Each of these components may be a unitary, continuous hoop or each of these components may be made from a plurality of arcuate segments that cumulatively form the annular structure. The components of the turbine section 28, such as the vane support 142, the BOAS support 152, the BOAS 134, 154, and the vane stage 146, may be made from a nickel based alloy and/or a cobalt based alloy, among others. For example, these components may be made from a high performance nickel-based super alloy or a cobalt-nickel-chromium-tungsten alloy. In various embodiments, the rotatable, traditionally static components of the turbine section may be made from other metals or metal alloys, such as stainless steel, etc. In various embodiments, these components are made of ceramic materials and/or ceramic matrix composites, among other materials.
[0038]
In various embodiments, and with reference to FIG. 4, multiple drive units 460A, 460B, 460C, 460D are provided for driving rotation of the vanes 446. The drive units 460A, 460B, 460C, 460D may be mounted to a radially outward surface of the turbine case 428. The drive gear may be spur gear 464A, 464D that engages one or more gear teeth tracks 441A. The drive system may include multiple drive units that are spaced apart axially from each other, such as drive units 460A, 460B, 460C. The drive system may also include multiple drive units that are spaced apart circumferentially from each other, such as drive units 460A and 460D. Circumferentially spaced apart drive units 460A, 460D may engage the same gear teeth track 441 or may engage different gear teeth tracks.
[0039]
In various embodiments, and with reference to FIG. 5, the drive system may include one or more drive units 560 for driving rotation of the vanes 546. The drive unit 560 may include a worm gear or a worm screw 564 as the drive gear. As mentioned above, the worm screw 564 may engage a gear teeth track 541 that is disposed on a radially outward surface of the vane support.
[0040]
In various embodiments, a method of operation of the gas turbine engine includes rotating at least one of a vane support, a vane stage, a blade outer air seal support, and a blade outer air seal of a gas turbine engine about an engine central longitudinal axis of the gas turbine engine. Rotating at least one of the vane support, the vane stage, the blade outer air seal support, and the blade outer air seal may include discrete incremental periodic rotational movements. For example, the drive system may be configured to move the vanes a certain angular distance at certain intervals. In various embodiments, the incremental angular distance may be equal to the pitch of the vane stage (e.g., angular distance between adjacent vanes of the vane stage). In such embodiments, each vane may be configured to spend an equal time directly downstream of the hot spot(s), thus allowing the heat load from the hot spots to be distributed across all of the vanes of the vane stage instead of being focused on one or a few vanes (as would be the situation in the traditional, static vane configuration). In various embodiments, the discrete incremental rotation may be actuated via the drive system before each flight, in response to the passage of a certain number of hours of engine operation, etc.
[0041]
In various embodiments, rotating at least one of the vane support, the vane stage, the blade outer air seal support, and the blade outer air seal includes continuous rotational movement. For example, the drive system may be configured to continuously rotate the vanes through the hot spot(s) during operation. In various embodiments, the rate of the continuous rotational movement is such that each vane is not directly downstream of the hot spot(s) long enough to reach a threshold temperature. For example, the drive system may be configured to maintain the rotational speed of the vanes above 6 rotations per minute (“RPM”). In such embodiments, each vane would pass through the hot spot in less than 0.15 seconds, which is less than the time it takes for the vane to reach peak steady state temperature (e.g., about 0.5 seconds). In various embodiments, the drive system may be configured to maintain the rotational speed of the vanes between 6 RPM and 20 RPM.
[0042]
In various embodiments, and with reference to FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 7, a method 790 of manufacturing/assembling a gas turbine engine is provided. The method 790 includes, according to various embodiments, forming a circumferentially extending gear teeth track 141A on at least one of a vane support, a vane stage, a blade outer air seal support, and a blade outer air seal of a turbine section of the gas turbine engine at step 792. The method may further include engaging a drive gear with the gear teeth track at step 794.
[0043]
In various embodiments, the method 790 may also include forming a pass-through hole 159A in a turbine case 128. This step may include forming multiple pass-through holes 159A, 159B, 159C and step 792 may include forming multiple gear teeth tracks 141A, 141B, 141C. The method 790 may include inserting multiple drive gears 164A, 164B, 164C through the multiple pass-through holes 159A, 159B, 159C to engage the multiple gear teeth tracks 141A, 141B, 141C, respectively.
[0044]
In various embodiments, the method includes forming a pass-through hole in a turbine case of the turbine section of the gas turbine engine and inserting the drive gear of a drive system through the pass-through hole to engage the drive gear with the gear teeth track. In various embodiments, the method may further include mounting a drive motor of the drive system to a radially outward surface of the turbine case of the turbine section of the gas turbine engine.
[0045]
As mentioned above and according to various embodiments, the gear teeth tracks 141A, 141B, 141C may be formed on various surfaces of the vane support 142. The method 790 may further include positioning bearings 121 between the vane support 142 and the turbine case 128 before coupling the vane support 142 to the turbine case 128 via the bearings 121. The method 790 may include coupling the vane stage 146 to the vane support 142 and coupling BOAS 134 to the turbine case 128. The method 790 may further include attaching a second BOAS 154 to a BOAS support 152 and coupling the BOAS support 152 to the turbine case 128.

The gas turbine engine 20 is disclosed herein as a two-spool turbofan that generally incorporates a fan section 22, a compressor section 24, a combustor section 26 and a turbine section 28. Alternative engines might include an augmentor section (not shown) among other systems or features. The fan section 22 drives air along a bypass flow path B in a bypass duct defined within a nacelle 15, while the compressor section 24 drives air along a core flow path C for compression and communication into the combustor section 26 then expansion through the turbine section 28. Although depicted as a two-spool turbofan gas turbine engine in the disclosed non-limiting embodiment, it should be understood that the concepts described herein are not limited to use with two-spool turbofans as the teachings may be applied to other types of turbine engines including three-spool architectures.
[0024]
The exemplary engine 20 generally includes a low speed spool 30 and a high speed spool 32 mounted for rotation about an engine central longitudinal axis A relative to an engine static structure 36 via several bearing systems 38. It should be understood that various bearing systems 38 at various locations may alternatively or additionally be provided, and the location of bearing systems 38 may be varied as appropriate to the application.
[0025]
The low speed spool 30 generally includes an inner shaft 40 that interconnects a fan 42, a first (or low) pressure compressor 44 and a first (or low) pressure turbine 46. The inner shaft 40 is connected to the fan 42 through a speed change mechanism, which in exemplary gas turbine engine 20 is illustrated as a geared architecture 48 to drive the fan 42 at a lower speed than the low speed spool 30. The high speed spool 32 includes an outer shaft 50 that interconnects a second (or high) pressure compressor 52 and a second (or high) pressure turbine 54. A combustor 56 is arranged in exemplary gas turbine 20 between the high pressure compressor 52 and the high pressure turbine 54. A mid-turbine frame 57 of the engine static structure 36 is arranged generally between the high pressure turbine 54 and the low pressure turbine 46. The mid-turbine frame 57 further supports bearing systems 38 in the turbine section 28. The inner shaft 40 and the outer shaft 50 are concentric and rotate via bearing systems 38 about the engine central longitudinal axis A which is collinear with their longitudinal axes.
[0026]
The core airflow is compressed by the low pressure compressor 44 then the high pressure compressor 52, mixed and burned with fuel in the combustor 56, then expanded over the high pressure turbine 54 and low pressure turbine 46. The mid-turbine frame 57 includes airfoils 59 which are in the core airflow path C. The turbines 46, 54 rotationally drive the respective low speed spool 30 and high speed spool 32 in response to the expansion. It will be appreciated that each of the positions of the fan section 22, compressor section 24, combustor section 26, turbine section 28, and fan drive gear system 48 may be varied. For example, gear system 48 may be located aft of combustor section 26 or even aft of turbine section 28, and fan section 22 may be positioned forward or aft of the location of gear system 48.
[0027]

[0028]
Figure 2 illustrates a BOAS segment 60 and a pair of retention clips 62A, 62B on opposed axial sides (e.g., relative to the engine central longitudinal axis A) of the BOAS segment 60. The individual BOAS segments 60 may be referred to individually as a ""BOAS segment"" or simply a ""BOAS."" The BOAS segments 60 may find beneficial use in many industries including aerospace, industrial, electricity generation, naval propulsion, pumps for gas in oil transmission, aircraft propulsion, vehicle engines and stationary power plants. While reference is specifically made herein to a BOAS segment, this disclosure could be used relative to other static segments within an engine, such as combustor panels or other structures.
[0029]
With continued reference to Figure 2, the BOAS segment 60 is supported radially outside (e.g., relative to a radial direction R, normal to the engine central longitudinal axis A) an array of rotor blades 64 (Figure 3) by way of the retention clips 62A, 62B and an engine case 66, in this example. In one example, the BOAS segments 60 may be arranged to form a full ring hoop assembly, which provides a sealing surface for the blades 64 to prevent leakage of the core airflow C over the blades 64.
[0030]
The BOAS segment 60 in this example includes fore and aft slots 68, 70 extending in a circumferential direction X between circumferential ends 72, 74 of the BOAS segment 60. In this example, the fore and aft slots 68, 70 span the entire circumferential length of the BOAS segment 60. The fore and aft slots 68, 70 are generally arcuate, and face along the engine central longitudinal axis A. The fore and aft slots 68, 70 are provided generally between a radially inner flange 76 of the BOAS segment 60 and a radially outer flange 78 thereof. In one example, the BOAS segment 60 includes at least one trough 80 between the circumferential ends 72, 74 for receiving a cooling flow of fluid. The trough 80 may be part of an overall cooling scheme for cooling portions of the BOAS segment 60.
[0031]
In one example, the BOAS segment 60 is made of a ceramic material. The BOAS segment 60 may be made of layered ceramic matrix composite (CMC) sheets or formed from a single monolithic block of ceramic. This disclosure extends to BOAS segments 60 made of other materials, however.
[0032]
The details of the retention clips 62A, 62B will be primarily discussed relative to retention clip 62A. It should be understood that, in this non-limiting example, the retention clip 62B includes the same features as the retention clip 62A, and would be arranged relative to the BOAS segment 60 in a similar manner.
[0033]
The retention clip 62A includes a main body portion 82 extending generally in the radial direction R. The retention clips 62A, 62B have a length L1 in a circumferential direction. The length L1 in this example is shorter than the circumferential length of the BOAS segment 60.
[0034]
To radially and axially support the BOAS segment 60, the retention clip 62A has first projection 84 projecting a first distance D1 from the main body portion 82. The first projection 84 includes a generally arcuate surface, corresponding to the arcuate shape of the fore slot 68 of the BOAS segment 60. As illustrated in Figures 3-4, the first projection 84 extends into the fore slot 68. A similar projection of the retention clip 62B is received in the aft slot 70 in the same way as the retention clip 62A.
[0035]
To circumferentially limit movement of the BOAS segment 60, the retention clip 62A includes a second projection 86 projecting a second distance D2 from the main body portion 82 than the first projection 84. The second distance D2 is larger than the first distance D1. The second projection 86 includes an inner surface 861 for abutting the circumferential end 72 of the BOAS segment 80 (shown in phantom in Figure 2).
[0036]
In order to support the retention clip 62A relative to the engine case 66, in this example, the retention clip 62A includes a groove 88 in a radially inner surface of the main body portion 82. The groove 88 extends circumferentially along the entire length L1 of the retention clip 62A. As shown in Figure 3, a support arm 90 of the engine case 66 extends into the groove 88 to radially support the retention clip 62A.
[0037]
For additional support, the main body portion 82 includes a front face 92 that abuts a radially extending flange 94 (Figure 3) connected to the engine case 66 to limit axial movement of the retention clip 62A relative to the engine case 66. The main body portion 82 further includes, in this example, a notch 96 in a radially outer surface 98 thereof for cooperation with an axially extending tab 97 (illustrated relative to retention clip 62B in Figure 3) of the engine case 66 (Figure 3). While a notch 96 and tab 97 are shown, other structures that would provide anti-rotation come within the scope of this disclosure. In this example, the notch 96 extends in a direction generally transverse to the length L1 of the retention clip 62A. The tab 97 prevents circumferential movement of the retention clip 62A relative to the engine case 66.
[0038]
Figure 4 is a close-up of the encircled area labeled ""Fig. 4"" in Figure 3, and illustrates four loads F1-F4 that may be experienced by the retention clip 62A during engine operation. As illustrated in Figure 4, there is a first load F1 between the first projection 84 of the retention clip 62A and the fore slot 68. A second load F2 is between the groove 88 and the arm 90 of the engine case 66. A third load F3 is established between the flange 94 extending from the engine case in contacting the face 92 of the retention clip 62A. A fourth load F4 is established between the forward face of clip 62A and the aft facing surface of arm 90. As the loads F1-F4 are applied, the retention clip 62A is retained in position relative to the engine case 66, and provides effective support for the BOAS segment 60.
[0039]
As illustrated in Figures 5A-5B, one of the groove 88 and the arm 90 may include a convex surface. In Figure 5A, a radially outer surface of the arm 90 includes a convex portion 90C for engagement with the groove 88 of the retention clip 62A. In Figure 5B, the groove 88 is provided with a convex portion 88C for engagement with the radially outer surface of the arm 90. In either case, the convex surface allows the retention clip 62A to essentially rock relative to the arm 90 in the direction D3 (Figure 5A). This reduces concentrated point loads as the BOAS segment 60 expands and contracts relative to the engine case 66 during operation.
[0040]
During operation of the engine, the BOAS segment 60, which may be made of ceramic, may reach temperatures that are relatively high for the engine case 66 (which itself may be made of a metallic material). In one particular example, the BOAS segment 60 is made from a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) material, such as ceramic or CMC. In this example, the BOAS segment 60 experiences small changes in shape due to changes in temperature during operation. The engine case 66, on the other hand, may be made from a material with a relatively high CTE, such as iron-based or nickel-based alloys, and experience relatively large changes in shape relative to the BOAS segment 60, even though the relative temperature of the case 66 may be substantially lower than the BOAS segment 60. The use of the retention clips 62A, 62B, allows the changes in shape between the BOAS segment 60 and the engine case 66 to occur, while maintaining a substantially consistent contact force F3. The retention clips 62A, 62B further provide a simplified design, and improve the structural reliability of the BOAS segment 60.
[0041]
In addition to supporting the BOAS segments 60 relative to the engine case 66, the retention clips 62A, 62B provide thermal insulation between the BOAS segments 60 and the engine case 66. In one example, the retention clips 62A, 62B, may be made of a ceramic material. In other examples, the retention clips 62A, 62B are made of another high temperature resistant material, such as a nickel-based (Ni-based) or cobalt-based (Co-based) alloy. Regardless of the material selected for the retention clips 62A, 62B, the retention clips 62A, 62B dissipate heat from the BOAS segment 60 and protect the engine case 66.
[0042]
While one particular retention clip arrangement is illustrated across Figures 2-5B, additional arrangements come within the scope of this disclosure. For instance, in Figure 6A, the retention clips 100A-100B have a main body portion 102 that is sized to be received in a channel 104 defined between the arms 90 of the engine case 66. The retention clips 100A-100B may then include projections 106 for receipt in the fore and aft slots 68, 70 of the BOAS segment, as substantially described above.
[0043]
With reference to Figure 6B, the retention clips 108A-108B may be provided with flanges 110 that extend radially outside of the radially outer flange 78 of the BOAS segment 60. The flanges 110 are received in a loop 112, which is connected to the engine case 66. While Figure 6A-6B illustrates two alternate examples, it should be understood that additional arrangements could come within the scope of this disclosure.
[0044]
It should be understood that terms such as ""fore,"" ""aft,"" ""axial,"" ""radial,"" and ""circumferential"" are used above with reference to the normal operational attitude of the engine 20. Further, these terms have been used herein for purposes of explanation, and should not be considered otherwise limiting. Terms such as ""generally,"" ""substantially,"" and ""about"" are not intended to be boundaryless terms, and should be interpreted consistent with the way one skilled in the art would interpret the term. The term ""clip"" as used herein is not intended to imply any structure associated with the act of ""clipping"" two elements together, such as in a clasp. Instead, the term ""clip"" is used herein to refer to a structure (e.g., the retention clips 62A, 62B) for holding and/or connecting structures together (e.g., the BOAS segment 60 and the engine case 66).
[0045]
Although the different examples have the specific components shown in the illustrations, embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to those particular combinations. It is possible to use some of the components or features from one of the examples in combination with features or components from another one of the examples.
[0046]
One of ordinary skill in this art would understand that the above-described embodiments are exemplary and non-limiting. That is, modifications of this disclosure would come within the scope of the claims. Accordingly, the following claims should be studied to determine their true scope and content.

Embodiment

Diagram in the accompanying drawing is schematic.Should point out,, will use identical reference character for the similar or similar elements in the different accompanying drawings.

Some features particularly advantage will make an explanation at the gas turbine of assembling, but apparently, each feature also can be applicable to the single parts of gas turbine, and only can show the advantage in assembling and operation period.But, when the gas turbine by operation period makes an explanation, should be limited to gas turbine in the operation without any details.

The present invention can be applicable to gas turbine engine, and it can generally include compressor section 1(and see Fig. 2), firing chamber part (not shown) and turbine part (not shown).The rotor (not shown) that the center is provided with is extensible by these three parts.Compressor section 1 can comprise the blade 10,11 of alternate row ... with the rotation blade (not shown).

The present invention is devoted to have "" guiding blade "" compressor (VGV).Here it is has the structure of variable pitch stator vane 10,11.

Explain the universal of "" guiding blade "" based on Fig. 1,2,3 and 4.These notions also are applicable to the present invention.The pitch or the angular variation of each grade blade in the compressor wall are controlled by linkage mechanism, and this linkage mechanism is from the applications of wall.

Each independent blade 10(first order), the 11(second level) ... be installed on the axle 22, to allow the angular motion of blade 10,11.It is the driving ring 40,41,42,43 of so-called unison that short operating handle 20 is connected to axle 22 as regulating ring.All blades 10,11 in the single level ... be connected to same ring, make all blades 10,11 of a level ... be conditioned with identical angle simultaneously.Fig. 1 has specifically shown the first order, for example each blade 10 of the upstream stage of compressor and corresponding operating handle 20 thereof.Fig. 2 shows the general view of compressor, and it has shown the blade 10 of the whole level of the first order.

Each operating handle 20 has the link 21 that operating handle 20 is connected to respective drive ring 40,41,42,43.Each driving ring 40,41,42,43 is by push rod 50 rotations from shared curved bar 61, and each encircles a push rod 50.

Basic system is as follows: the plunger actuator 60 that may be hydraulic pressure is with lateral movement (m1 represents by arrow).This lateral movement is led curved bar 61 and is rotated.Curved bar can have the dissimilar arm 62,63,64 of band different length, arm of every grade blade.Arm 62 is longer than arm 63, and they are longer than arm 64 again.Push rod 50 as operating handle of the present invention is attached to these arms.Therefore, rotatablely moving of curved bar 61 is applied directly to push rod 50, thereby the lateral movement of push rod 50 is provided.The other end diagram of push rod 50 makes the lateral movement of push rod 50 directly impel driving ring 40,41,42,43 to carry out rotatablely moving shown in arrow s1, s2, s3, s4 to driving ring 40,41,42,43.Because the arm of different length, rotatablely moving may be different, and for example a ring may encircle rotate less than another.

Use single drive plunger, the position, angle during the plunger stroke is proportional at inter-stage.

Rotatablely moving of driving ring 40,41,42,43 is applied to each blade 10,11 as rotatablely moving shown in the arrow m2 by link 21 ... operating handle 20.Thereby the initial movement of plunger 60 causes the rotation of blade 10,11.

Fig. 5 schematically shows the spring push-rod operating handle (sprung push rod lever) 1 according to decomposition of the present invention, and it will substitute in the push rod 50 at least one.Spring push-rod operating handle 1 comprises spring 70, have first main body 101 of first end 51, have center hole lid 102, have the spring bracket 104 of second connecting end 52.

First end 51 can be set to be connected to one of driving ring 40,41,42,43.Second end 52 can be set to be connected to curved bar 61.

First main body 101 can be screwed in lid 102.Spring bracket 104 and spring 70 are positioned at the chamber by first main body 101 and lid 102 members.The two all can have adequate space, makes that spring push-rod operating handle 1 end and the overall length between the end can be according to the power that applies and different.

Can imagine that other forms of push rod operating handle 1 can show the similar operation pattern.

If first order blade 10 has only a spring push-rod operating handle 1, the push rod 50 of fixed length is used for other levels, and then possible is, during operation, driving ring 40 is compared with driving ring 41,42,43 at the different time setting in motion.Advantageously, this used between the starting period of gas turbine engine.

And between the starting period of turbine, the present invention also allows:

The position, angle of-first order blade 10 keeps constant up to the neutral position for the plunger stroke of initial length (for example 10mm) when other level is rotated.

-after the plunger stroke of initial length (for example 10 mm), comprise that the blade of all grades of the first order rotates by the direct proportaion mode.

The latter realizes that by forward backstop 150 this forward backstop is placed on the unison at the plunger stroke point of 10 mm.In detail referring to Figure 10.

In the down periods of turbine, be designed as compliant device with the locking lever flexing in order to allow plunger stroke to be back to the inactive initial position of 0 mm-turbine-push rod operating handle 1.This device is the form-spring bracket 104 of the piston that slides in closed cylinder, when being stretched, piston leans against on the backstop 110 and transmits all power.When being pushed into, piston leans against on the spring 70.Referring to Fig. 8.

This rigidity is enough high, with can deflection during normal travel, during except unison 40 collision backstops 150.At the point of collision backstop 150, length of spring compressed, thus allow the angle in continuous plunger stroke and the every other level to change.

Except above-mentioned, the present invention also allows to solve following problems.

When axial compressor 1 running with some grades, the compression of passing the air of this compressor 1 realizes that gradually each level has similar compression ratio, thereby the area of the gas circuit by compressor is designed to reduce gradually.When unusual low speed, the startup and the down periods of the motor that runs in first prime according to the blade 10 of Fig. 2 and 11, can not provide enough compressions to make air-flow pass back level-be attached to the blade of ring 43, this becomes "" obstruction "".When this situation takes place when, flow and can on the surface, suction side of one or more levels, separate, thereby cause this level "" stall "", then be flowing in this level oppositely, thus make other grades stall gradually, almost stall at once, reverse in being flowing in whole compressor 1.When this situation takes place when, reflux by compressor 1 from the high-pressure air of compressor outlet, when pressure wave arrives the suction port of compressor, cause suddenly "" bang "" ring.This bang is called as "" surge "", and can be thought little blast by observer out of the picture.Usually, surge will repeat to take place, and stop up to motor.

When arbitrary given speed, exist whole compressor 1 or at different levels under the situation of not stall attainable pressure maximum ratio, and, operation pressure during this speed than and maximum value between difference be called as "" stall margin "".

In order to prevent the surge on the multistage axial compressor, some grades guiding blade uses when compressor starts, the flow rate during with minimizing low speed.When low speed, these guiding blades are closed, and along with speed increases towards running, these guiding blades are opened to its running position, and are moving to pass through more multithread.Guiding blade is generally by single actuator (according to plunger 60 and the curved bar 61 of Fig. 2) motion, and wherein mechanical linkage can make the different amounts of continuous level motion, but according to prior art, all levels relative to each other are synchronized with the movement.

For some compressors, the optimal movement of each on the velocity range grade is followed different patterns with other grades.However,, may exist actual consideration keeping single actuator and single connecting rod, thereby still use the trade-off relation of guiding blade motion and speed for reliability reasons.This is solved by the present invention.

Spring push-rod operating handle 1 of the present invention provides the simple mechanism that changes the relative movement between at different levels, and can not introduce extra actuator or complicated linkages, realizes to be selected better compromise and the start-up reliability of better motor is provided.Can be applicable to the arbitrary level in the variable stage, or the starting point of actuator movements, or the running end.Described present invention has been applied to be called all the time first variable row of the first order in this document.

Utilize actuator, in initial position, the ring that makes first order motion is pushed backstop 150 on the motor body to by spring push-rod operating handle 1, and its medi-spring 70 is compressed in push rod operating handle 1.

When actuator (according to plunger 60 and the curved bar 61 of Fig. 2) when initial position (being restricted to 0mm) is shifted to neutral position (for example 10mm), ring 40 still is pushed to backstop, thereby first order blade 10 can not move, and actuator directly makes stators (for example blade 11) motion of other row.Between this moving period, the spring 70 in the push rod operating handle 1 unloads gradually, allow actuator end (the second end 52) motion of push rod operating handle 1, and ring holds (first end 51) to keep static, and ring is held against backstop 150 by spring force.

When the neutral position of 10mm, push rod operating handle 1 can not further extend, and therefore, the actuator movements that surpasses the neutral position causes the first order and other stators to move according to the geometrical shape of actuator mechanism jointly.Thereby between neutral position and running position, push rod operating handle 1 is equivalent to the spring lower device, if like this.

When push rod operating handle 1 was in its complete extension state, the spring 70 in the push rod operating handle 1 had obvious preload, was enough to make first order ring 40 to move above middle actuator position along both direction between on-stream period.

When killing engine, actuator moves to initial position gradually according to predetermined schedule from the running position.Be reduced to the neutral position of 10mm up to actuator, the preload in the spring 70 is enough to make 40 motions of first order ring, and can not carry out any compression to spring 70.In the neutral position, ring 40 collision backstops 150 can not further be moved.Along with actuator continues motion, spring 70 is compressed, and allow actuator end (the second end 52) motion of push rod operating handle 1, and the ring end of push rod operating handle 1 (first end 51) maintenance is static.

The present invention allows another level closely to move with respect to the first order with low speed.Especially, allow the additional movements of the guiding blade mechanism of another grade, keep the first order constant simultaneously.

The initial angle of the first level Four variable-vane can be some specific angles, for example 35o, 30o, 25o and 20o between the starting period of machine.But also can think during machine operation, to have specific blade angle, for example: 35o, 21o, 16o, 10o.Back one plan should be as far as possible closely followed in the motion of guiding blade.

The plan of summarizing among Figure 12 also should be corresponding to the speed shown in the chart among Figure 13, and its setting with spring push-rod operating handle 1 compares with the setting with standard fixed push rod 50.

Such operation can be by spring push-rod operating handle 1(referring to Fig. 5 and 7) provide, it connects with mechanical stop 150, so that the first order is remained on initial angle, and 35o for example, and change the length of york piece on distributor axis, to extract bigger stroke from another level.

When the first order was remained on initial angle, push rod operating handle 1 needed to shorten 10mm(and adopts above-mentioned example value), thus allow the further shuttling movement of another level to its desired location.

Mechanical stop about the first order:

Spring push-rod operating handle 1 needs mechanical stop 150 to limit first order stroke, and this can use some simple bracket that are attached to unison 40 and housing 160 and construct.Referring to Figure 10.

About spring push-rod operating handle 1:

The present invention allows by spring 70 transmission power, and push rod length is not carried out any change, and this means that this first order will can be with correct speed motion.

This realizes by spring 70, and the spring 70 in the system must have the power bigger preload more required than mobile first order unison 40.

As example, the first order unison 40 required power that move on the specific gas turbine can be referring to Figure 14.

Preferably, spring 70(is referring to Fig. 9) can be to have certain stiffness, the die springs of 159 N/mm for example.As another example value, the compression of 2.5mm can offer spring 70 at assembly process, so that the initial preload of 397.5N to be provided, thereby guarantees that plunger pressure is transmitted not allowing first order blade to fall behind under the situation of remaining part of mechanism.Shown in, all values is exemplary.

The design of spring push-rod operating handle 1 is based on the spring size with up to the required running length in neutral position, for example 10mm.Two linings that formed by the DU material can be used for the guiding blade axle at each end, thereby allow axle freely turning round in main body.Referring to Fig. 8.

Figure 15 shows the system of turbine between the starting period.Generator when Figure 15 A demonstration is in idle running in case do not operate.All operating handles of guiding blades at different levels, operating handle 1, operating handle 2, operating handle 3 have equal length ideally.This usually can be not necessarily.

First end 51 of operating handle (operating handle 1, operating handle 2, operating handle 3) will be attached to regulating ring 40,41,42(is not shown), guiding blade 10,11 ... obtain the position by regulating ring 40,41,42.

Between the starting period, curved bar 61 slightly rotates.As a result, second end 52 of all operating handles (operating handle 1, operating handle 2, operating handle 3) reduces.For operating handle 2, operating handle 3, this position to first end 51 of these two operating handles has direct influence, shown in Figure 15 B.First end 51 of first operating handle 1 the start up period since the length of extending operating handles 1 by spring 70 obtain balance and do not change the position.Alternate position spike can be apart from d1.Operating handle 1 extends its bar portion (part that is denoted as length X will extend to X+d1), up to arriving the position (shown in Figure 15 B) that before had been called the neutral position.

In case between the starting period through the neutral position, operating handle 1 will no longer absorb the motion that is further rotated of curved bar 61, but will directly transmit the longitudinal movement of its second end 52-make it, thereby cause the motion of first end 51 of operating handle 1 as shaft-like operating handle 2 or operating handle 3 or slight absorption.Thereby, be further rotated curved bar 61 second end 52 will be led to be lower than the neutral position apart from d2.Same case is especially all set up for all three first ends 51 of operating handle 1 for operating handle 1, operating handle 2, operating handle 3.The part of first operating handle 1 (before by the X mark and subsequently by the X+d1 mark) will rest on the extended position that its length is X+d1.

As can be seen, the blade of the first order will no longer be operated with the blade synchronization of other grades.

Embodiment

Fig. 1 is the perspective side figure of exemplary wind turbine 100.In this exemplary embodiment, wind turbine 100 is horizontal axis wind turbines.Or wind turbine 100 can be vertical axis wind turbine.Wind turbine 100 has the pylon 102 that extends from supporting surface 104, is connected to the cabin 106 on pylon 102, and is connected to the rotor 108 on cabin 106.Rotor 108 has rotatable hub 110 and is connected to a plurality of rotor blades 112 on hub 110.In this exemplary embodiment, rotor 108 has three rotor blades 112.Or rotor 108 has any amount of rotor blade 112 that wind turbine 100 can be worked as described herein.In this exemplary embodiment, pylon 102 is made by tubulose steel, and has the cavity (not showing in Fig. 1) extending between supporting surface 104 and cabin 106.Or pylon 102 is any pylons that wind turbine 100 can be worked as described herein, includes but not limited to grid pylon.Pylon 102 has any suitable height that wind turbine 100 can be worked as described herein.

Rotor blade 112 is positioned at around hub 110, to contribute to making rotor 108 rotations, thereby converts the kinetic energy from wind 124 to spendable mechanical energy, and converts subsequently electric energy to.Rotor 108 and cabin 106 rotate around pylon 102 in yaw axes 116, to control rotor blade 112 with respect to the projection (perspective) of the direction of wind 124.Rotor blade 112 is by being connected to root of blade part 120 on hub 110 and mating with hub 110 at 122 places, a plurality of load transfer zone.Load transfer zone 122 has hub load transfer zone and blade loading transmission region (both all do not show in Fig. 1).The load causing in rotor blade 112 is delivered on hub 110 by load transfer zone 122.Each rotor blade 112 also comprises tip segment 125.

In this exemplary embodiment, rotor blade 112 has the length between 30 meters (m) (98 feet (ft)) and 100m (328ft), but these parameters do not form restriction to the disclosure.Or rotor blade 112 can have any length that wind turbine 100 can be worked as described herein.When wind 124 clashes into each rotor blade 112, on each rotor blade 112, cause blade lift (not shown), and when each rotor blade 112 and tip segment 125 acceleration, cause that rotor 108 is around the rotation of spin axis 114.Can be changed by blade pitch control mechanism (not showing) the propeller pitch angle (not shown) of rotor blade 112 in Fig. 1, determine that each rotor blade 112 is with respect to the angle of the projection of the direction of wind 124.Especially, the propeller pitch angle of increase rotor blade 112 can reduce the blade table area 126 that is exposed to wind 124 (reduce the airfoil angle of attack, and reduce to be thus applied to the lift on rotor blade 112) of corresponding rotor blade 112.On the contrary, the propeller pitch angle that reduces blade 112 can increase the blade table area 126 that is exposed to wind 124 (increase the airfoil angle of attack, and increase lift thus in the situation that there is no stall) of corresponding rotor blade 112.

For example, the blade pitch angle (being sometimes referred to as "" power position "") of approximately 0 degree makes the blade table area 126 of sizable percentage be exposed to wind 124, thereby causes causing the first lift value on blade 112.Similarly, the blade pitch angle (being sometimes referred to as "" feather position "") of approximately 90 degree makes the blade table area 126 of much lower percentage be exposed to wind 124, thereby causes causing the second lift value on blade 112.The the first lift value causing on rotor blade 112 is greater than the second lift value causing on rotor blade 112, thereby makes lift value proportional with the blade table area 126 (being the airfoil angle of attack) that is exposed to wind 124.Therefore the lift value, causing on rotor blade 112 and the value at blade pitch angle are proportional.

And for example, when blade lift increases, the rotational speed of rotor blade 112 and tip segment 125 increases.On the contrary, when blade lift reduces, the rotational speed of rotor blade 112 and tip segment 125 reduces.Therefore, the value of the linear velocity of tip segment 125 and the lift value causing on rotor blade 112 are proportional, and rotational speed and the blade pitch angle of rotor blade 112 and tip segment 125 is proportional as can be seen here.

In addition, when the rotational speed of rotor blade 112 and tip segment 125 increases, from the amplitude (not shown) of the acoustic emission (not showing in Fig. 1) of blade 112, increase.On the contrary, when the rotational speed of rotor blade 112 and tip segment 125 reduces, from the amplitude of the acoustic emission of rotor blade 112, reduce.Therefore, proportional from the amplitude of acoustic emission and the rotational speed of rotor blade 112 and tip segment 125 of rotor blade 112, and proportional from amplitude and the blade pitch angle of the acoustic emission of rotor blade 112 as can be seen here.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The present patent application relates to a wind turbine having a rotor with a first rotor blade and a pitch control system. Further, present patent application relates to a controller for controlling a pitch angle of at least one rotor blade of a wind turbine. Finally, the present patent application relates to a method for controlling a pitch velocity of a rotor blade of a wind turbine.

In case of an emergency event, e.g. the loss of the grid, a wind turbine has to be stopped as fast as possible. Therefore, rotor blades of a wind turbine are rotated from a working position into a feathered position. For this purpose emergency pitch systems are used. The velocity of the rotation is often not controlled since in many emergency events a pitch controller is not powered and therefore not in operation. The desired velocity for rotating the rotor blade from an operating position to a feathered position is primarily taken to reduce the power output as quick as possible, not to reduce the turbine loads resulting from this action. For example if the rotor blades are rotated too fast from the operating position into the safety or feathered position, the rotor is still rotating with relatively high speed when the rotor blades are brought into the feathered position. In this case high forces may be created that suck the rotor into the direction of the wind so that the wind turbine might be damaged. Thus, in previous wind turbines the pitch velocity is fixed or limited such that such large forces are avoided. These fixed pitch velocities are normally very low, e.g. 8° per second. As the at the time of the design and construction of the wind turbine the circumstances of emergency events are obviously not known, the fixed pitch velocities are independent from the wind conditions and meet worst case scenarios. For limiting the pitch velocity, emergency pitch systems often contain a safety brake system.

Other known emergency pitch systems are provided with energy storage devices, e.g. accumulators, batteries or capacitors. The energy storage devices power the pitch controller during a grid outage and enable a rotation of the rotor blade from the operating position into the feathered position. If accumulators or capacitors are used, they are charged during normal operation of the wind turbine.

Further, specific embodiments of known emergency systems have a direct electrical connection between the energy storage devices and a pitch motor that drives the rotor blade. In the latter case the pitch velocity is uncontrolled since the velocity of the pitch system depends on the counter torque it has to overcome and energy storage charge/performance status of the energy storage device, e.g. the battery or the accumulator.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Reference will now be made in detail to the various embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the figures. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, and is not meant as a limitation of the invention. For example, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on or in conjunction with other embodiments to yield yet a further embodiment. It is intended that the present invention includes such modifications and variations.

FIG. 1 shows a wind turbine 100 with a tower 110, a nacelle 120, a hub 130 connected to the nacelle 120 and a rotor with three rotor blades 140. The nacelle 120 is mounted on the tower 110 of the wind turbine 100 and may be rotated about a vertical axis to position the rotor in an optimal position with respect to the wind. The rotor blades 140 are connected to the hub. The wind turbine 100 may also include less or more rotor blades 140, for example a single rotor blade, two rotor blades or four and more rotor blades 140. The wind rotor of the wind turbine includes the rotor blades 140 and the hub 130. A generator (not shown) is arranged in the nacelle. The generator is connected to the hub 130 directly or via a gear box. The wind turbine 100 works as follows for transforming kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy: The wind is an air flow that impinges onto the rotor blades 140 of the rotor and forces the rotor to rotate around its horizontal axis. This rotation is transferred to the generator that transforms the mechanical rotation into an electrical current. The electrical current is fed into the grid or utility grid.

Each rotor blade 140 is rotatable around its longitudinal axis in order to position the rotor blades 140 at a specific pitch angle. The maximum rotation about the longitudinal axis of the blade during operation of the wind turbine defines a pitch range of the rotor blade 140. In FIG. 2, four different pitch angles are shown. In a 0° position A, the rotor blade 140 is positioned such that it presents lift of which a component is driving the rotor. The lift is depending on the relative wind direction, which is the resultant wind direction of the wind and the air flow due to the rotation of the rotor. The lift is always perpendicular to the relative wind direction. A second operation position is the position B. That is the position of the rotor blade 140 is chosen to limit the lift and therefore limit the torque and the thrust. The operating position B may vary depending on wind conditions. In the operating position B the wind is imparting a torque on the rotor such that the rotor rotates in the rotating direction T. Therefore, in the operating positions A and B, the kinetic energy of the wind is transformed into rotational energy. The generator transforms the rotational energy into electrical energy which is then fed into the grid. Under some conditions, the 0° position may also be an operating position. Further, the rotor blade 140 may be rotated into a feathered position D. In the feathered position D, the rotor speed is reduced due to a high air resistance of the blade in the rotation direction T. It should be noted that the feathered position D may also have another position than exactly a 90° position. In the feathered position D the rotor blade 140 does not cerate any rotational energy due to the aerodynamic forces created by an oncoming wind. Further, the 90° position may be different to the position in which no torque on the rotor is produced, which will result in an idling speed of 0 rpm (no movement). The difference between the two positions may be in the order of 0° to 5°. In fact, the feathered position is the position in which the rotor blade 140 has to be rotated in cases of emergency stop situations. Thus, the rotor is not accelerated but decelerated as in wind direction W the rotor blade 140 presents essentially no air resistance. A continuously variable pitch may operate with a pitch angle between 0 and 90 degrees in which the parking or feathered position represents the position in which the wind turbine rotor blade 140 being rotated substantially out of the wind. The pitch range in this example is 90°, namely from the 0° position A to the feathered position D. Other pitch ranges may be possible, e.g. the rotor blade 140 may not adapted to reach the 0° position, or the feathered position D is not exactly a 90° position.

Between the operating position B and the parking or feathered position D, the rotor blade 140 has a neutral position C in which a balance of rotational forces about the longitudinal axis of the rotor blade 140 is established as it will be explained in the following. The wind forces push the rotor blade into the feathered position D, such that, in consequence, a pitch motor has to drive the rotor blade against the wind forces into the operating position B and either the pitch motor or another device retains or locks the blade in the operating position. Further, in case the wind turbine 100 is optimally positioned to the wind, i.e. the horizontal axis of rotation of the wind rotor is parallel to the wind direction W, and when the wind rotor is rotating, an air stream opposite to the rotation direction T exerts rotational forces on the rotor blade to the 0° position A. The neutral position C is the position where the torques around the longitudinal axis of the rotor blade 140 due the wind forces and the forces of the air stream neutralize each other, in other words that the torques around the longitudinal axis of the rotor blade 140 are balanced. It should be noted that the neutral position C may be different from a position of the rotor blade at which the rotor does no longer get energy out of the wind. This may depend on the airfoil of the blade 140.

If the wind rotor stands still and the blades are in the feathered position D, a motor rotates the rotor blade 140 from the feathered position D into the operating position B against the wind forces that try to push the rotor blade 140 back into the feathered position D. If the rotor is rotating and the rotor blades has to be brought from the operating position B into the feathered position D and no other velocity regulating devices, e.g. a break, are used, the wind forces are pushing the blade into the neutral position C. For the further movement from the neutral position C to the feathered position D, the pitch motor rotates the rotor blade against the forces of the air stream. If the wind rotor is rotating and the rotor blade 140 is in the feathered position D, the forces of the air stream push the rotor blade from the feathered position D into the neutral position C. For the further movement from the neutral position C to the operating position B, the pitch motor rotates the rotor blade against the wind forces.

Thus, without brakes or pitch motors to control the pitch of the rotor blade, the rotor blade would always rotate into the neutral position C. It should be noted that the neutral position C as well as the optimal operating position B depend on the wind force on the site where the wind turbine 100 is constructed.

Once a controller of any form is part of the emergency pitch system, one can use the controller to optimize the pitch angular position and speed over the course of an emergency event. At first, a pre-defined pitch speed profile can be used. However, this assumes that one can map the optimum behavior in advance.

FIG. 3 shows a schematical drawing of a pitch control system 200. A pitch control system 200 may also have more parts which are not shown in the drawing for the sake of simplicity. Furthermore, only one rotor blade 140 is shown. The pitch control system 200 may control the pitch of one or more rotor blades 140, e.g. two, three or more blades of the wind turbine 100. The rotor blade 140 may be rotated about its longitudinal axis within a pitch range from about 0° to about 90°, which has already been discussed with respect to FIG. 2. A pitch motor 210 is associated to each rotor blade 140 of the rotor to adjust the pitch angle. The pitch angle may be any position within the pitch range. It should be noted, that it is also possible to associate several pitch motors 210 to a single rotor blade 140, e.g. two or three pitch motors 210. In a typical embodiment, the pitch motor(s) 210 is/are arranged in the hub 130.

In case of losing the connection to the grid or another emergency situation, the wind turbine 100 might not receive power from the grid to perform the emergency actions, among which pitching of the rotor blade 140 to position D. To maintain the operation of the pitch control system during such grid outage, a controller 220 of the pitch control system 200, e.g. a programmable logic controller (PLC), must be supplied with energy. The electrical energy needed to power the pitch controller 220 during emergency events is generally stored in an electrical energy storing device, e.g. an accumulator 230, ultra caps or super caps. As long as it is available, the accumulator 230 is charged with electricity from the grid or by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). It should be noted that the emergency power supply for the controller 220 may be a different one than for the drive system for the pitch, e.g. the pitch motor(s) 210. E.g. the emergency power supply for the controller 220 may be a capacitor, like a ultra or super cap, and the emergency power supply for the drive system may be a spring as it will be explained here below.

According to an embodiment, the pitch motor 210 is adapted to work as a generator. As already explained with respect to FIG. 2, the rotor blade 140 may be rotated from the operating position B to the neutral position C only by the wind forces. A part of that energy used to rotate the rotor blade 140 may be transformed into electrical energy by the pitch motor 210. Thus, electrical current produced by the pitch motor 210 may be fed to the controller 220 to power the controller 220. In a further embodiment, the produced energy may be used to charge an accumulator 230. When the motor is operated as a generator, the motor is imparting a counter torque against the diving torque exerted onto the motor by the rotating blade. That means, in that case, the motor is working as a brake, thus reducing the pitch velocity. In other words, the generator counter torque acts as a braking torque reducing the pitch velocity of the rotor blade. This effect may be used to control the pitch velocity of the rotor blade 140 between the operating position B and the neutral position C.

Further, —the pitch controller 220 may regulate the pitch speed by using the motor 210 as a generator which dumps the excess power in an electrical energy storage device, e.g. the accumulator 230 or a specific accumulator for a pitch motor 210 or any other suitable storage device. Furthermore, the electricity can be used to provide energy to another emergency pitch system, e.g. a pitch motor of another rotor blade of the rotor. Additionally, in a specific embodiment, the electrical energy might be fed back into the grid 215. Finally, in a further embodiment, the electricity might be fed into a dump load, resistor or a brake chopper. Also, a combination of several or all of the discussed loads may be used in an embodiment. In a further embodiment, the generated electricity may be used to power and move tip brakes of the rotor blade 140 or of other rotor blades of the rotor. The electric load could be varied in a typical mode, such that the brake torque induced by the motor 210 and thus the pitch velocity may be controlled between the operating position B and the neutral position C. It should be noted, that, in a typical embodiment, the pitch motor 210 may not work as a brake in the complete angular range between the operating position B and the neutral position C, but only in a part of the angular range between the operating position B and the neutral position C.

Further it should be noted that the motor may also be operated as a generator in the case of a rotating wind rotor when the blades are in the feathered position. In this event, the air stream forces the rotor blades into the neutral position, and the pitch motor may be operated in the generator mode during the rotation of the blade from the feathered position D to the neutral position C.

In a typical embodiment, the blade 140 may be driven from the 0°-position A or the operating position B to the feathered position D by one or more springs 240. The spring 240 could be a helical spring, a coil spring, a pneumatic spring or a combination of the foregoing. Also other devices for storing mechanical energy could be used instead of a spring. Thus, in case of an emergency event, if the electricity from the grid 215 is cut, the rotor blade 140 could nevertheless return into the feathered position D to stop the rotor without the need to use the pitch motor 210 for actively driving the rotor blade 140 during the complete pitch movement between the operating position B and the feathered position D. During the blade rotation from the operating position B into the feathered position D, the energy stored in the spring 240 drives the rotor blade 140 and thus also the pitch motor 210. The motor 210 may now be operated as a generator so that it generates energy for providing electrical power to the loads, as already described here-above, e.g. for charging the accumulators with the excess power. Simultaneously, the counter or brake torque of pitch motor 210 being operated as a generator reduces the pitch velocity of the blade so that the pitch motor 210 serves as a brake.

In a typical embodiment of the wind turbine, the pitch velocity is controlled depending on a signal of a sensor.

In a further embodiment, if the spring is pre-stressed to or in the feathered position D, the pitch motor 210 may produce electrical energy during the complete movement from the operation position B to the feathered position D. It should be noted, that, in a further embodiment, the pitch motor 210 may not serve as a brake in the complete range between the neutral position C and the feathered position D, but only in a part of the range between the neutral position C and the feathered position D. This depends on the dimension and the arrangement of the spring 240. In a typical embodiment, the spring 240 is located in the hub 130.

In case the pitch controller 220 is no longer active, either due to lack of power provided by the grid 215, the accumulator 230 or the pitch motor 210, the pitch control system 200 may include a brake, e.g. a centrifugal brake, that limits the pitch velocity of the rotor blade 140, typically if the pitch system is be driven by springs 240. Further, in an embodiment at a 90° position, the blade 140 is blocked, such that a further rotation about the longitudinal axis of the blade 140 is limited. Thus, the blocking prevents a further rotation in normal operation of the wind turbine.

In a further embodiment, the controller is further adapted to electrically connect the motor operating in the generator mode to an accumulator, a second motor for adjusting a pitch angle of a second rotor blade, or a dump load.

In emergency brake situations, the rotor blade 140 has to be rotated from its operation position B into the feathered position D as fast as possible. But, if the pitch has passed the neutral position C, suction forces are exerted on the hub 130 pulling the hub a direction opposite to the wind direction W. These forces may damage or even destroy the wind turbine 100 if they are too high. Therefore, during the deceleration process of the wind rotor, it is important to control the pitch velocity. Accordingly, the pitch control system 200 has at least one sensor 250 that is connected to a controller 230. In a specific embodiment, the measured value of the sensor may be a controlled process variable. For example, the sensor 250 is a vibration sensor located in the rotor blade 140, hub 130, nacelle 120 or tower top. In a typical embodiment of the present patent application, the sensor 250 includes at least one accelerometer, in particular an accelerometer for detecting a back and forth movement. The accelerometer may be located in the hub 130 near the blade root of said rotor blade 140. These accelerometers can measure the suction force exerted on the rotor of the wind turbine 100. According to another embodiment, the sensor 250 may include a position and speed sensor for the rotor, a stress or strain sensor in structural components, e.g. the rotor blade 140, a blade bearing, the hub 130, shaft, frames, or the tower 110. According to further embodiments, the sensor 250 may be adapted to measure wind speed or wind direction. In a typical embodiment, the sensor 240 may be a rotational speed sensor of the rotor, a sensor for measuring the position of the rotor, a sensor measuring the pitch angle of at least one rotor blade. Further, a turbine controller may provide a signal to the pitch controller, as via the turbine controller other signals may be relayed directly or indirectly. This data may be historical data, actual data of predictions based on historic data.

The signals of one or more sensors 250 are used by the controller 230 to control the pitch velocity of the rotor blade 140 or of all rotor blades 140. For example, if back and forth accelerometers are used as sensors 250 to produce a feedback signal, the pitch velocity might be limited to a value such that loads to which the components of the wind turbine 100 are designed are limited, e.g. to avoid an overstress of the tower structure.

Thus, in a first control strategy the feedback signal of the above sensor 250 is used to control the pitch velocity.

Further, the pitch controller 220 may use a second control strategy in which maps of expected turbine behavior on/of components in the turbine, such as torque, forces, motion (tower closest approach), speed and acceleration are used for control. These variables may be mapped depending on operational variables as pitch angles, rotor speed and position, torque, power. For example, a blade in a 6 o'clock position may be pitched at a higher speed than a blade in a 12 o'clock position, as the thrust is a function of the windspeed and thus a function of the ground height. Wind speed and direction in the recent history (second, minutes), air temperature in recent history, set values for individual turbines (e.g. altitude, altitude and temperature yield density), and turbine configuration parameters. In a further embodiment, the controller 220 may take into account short term prediction of the signals.

Instead of a or additional to the sensor signal, the controller 230 of the pitch control system 200 might use input from the turbine controller through which other signals may be relayed directly or indirectly.

The pitch controller may also use the following, third control strategy which utilizes predefined set position profiles given from the turbine master PLC. Thus, the action of the pitch controller 220 alone accelerometer as well as the turbine master PLC alone or a combination of both.

The control strategies discussed above may be used alone or in combination. Furthermore, the rotor blades 140 of a wind rotor may be separately controlled by the controller 220, as e.g. the wind speed may differ for a rotor blade during the rotation of the rotor. Therefore, the different rotor blades 140 of the same rotor may be independently rotated about their longitudinal axis to the feathered position D. In order to keep the loads down, the rotor blades may be rotated in symmetry about their longitudinal axis. That means the rotor blades should all have about the same pitch angle all the time. Therefore, the independent controllers for each rotor blades may each take into account the pitch angle of the other rotor blades. This may only be done when the rotor is no longer accelerating. As long as the rotor is accelerating or at a too high rotor speed, all blades should go as fast as they can into the feathered position.

In a further embodiment, the torque of the wind rotor may also be regulated in dependence of the values delivered by the sensor 250. For that purpose, the sensor 250 or the controller 220 may be connected to a wind turbine controller, typically located in the nacelle.

In a further embodiment, a mechanical pitch system may be used. FIG. 4 shows such a pitch control system 300. The rotor blade 140 is than driven by a hydraulical or pneumatic actuator 310. The hydraulical or pneumatic actuator 310 may be located in the nacelle 120 or in the rotor 130. The hydraulic actuator may be a two way actuator such that it may actively rotate the rotor blade around its longitudinal axis from the feathered position D to the 0° position and, if necessary, actively rotate the blade from the 0° position or the operating position to the feathered position D e.g. from a feathered position D to a operating position B. In case of a one way pneumatic or hydraulical actuator 310, the actuator may work against a spring 320 that forces the rotor blades into the feathered position for effecting a rotor stop or into a position where the rotor does not longer get energy out of the wind. The hydraulical or pneumatic actuator 310 is connected via a valve 330 to a reservoir 340. The reservoir 340 may be a pressure reservoir in case of a pneumatic actuator or a hydraulic reservoir with a nitrogen bubble. A pitch controller 350 controls the valve 350 depending on a signal of a pitch sensor 360, such that the pitch is correctly set. In case of a stop process, e.g. an emergency stop operation, wind energy can be transformed into a mechanical energy and stored in the reservoir 340. As already explained for the embodiment with a pitch system with the motor 210 shown in FIG. 3, the wind forces the rotor blade from a operating position, e.g. 0° position A or operating position B, in direction of the feathered position, in addition the force exerted by the spring 320. The valve 330 is adapted to guide a fluid pressure generated by the spring 320 and/or the wind on the rotor blade in the actuator into the reservoir. Thus, in the reservoir the pressure of the air in case of a pneumatical pitch system or the pressure of the nitrogen bubble in case of a hydraulic pitch system is increased. This stored mechanical energy may used later, if the rotor blade has to be pitched from the feathered position D into an operating position. In a specific embodiment, the spring 320 may be integrated into the hydraulical or pneumatic actuator 310.

An advantage of the embodiment with a spring driven pitch system is that there is no necessity to distinguish between an emergency operation and a controlled automatic mode. Only when the pitch controller 220 fails, the emergency operation is unregulated. As long the pitch controller 220 is running, a position and velocity control mode is always active and emergency operation mode is only “hot stand by”. Thus, the present patent application has the advantage that the loads exerted on structural components of the wind turbine can be lowered in some load cases. Therefore, lower cost components may be used. The emergency situation may also be triggered by a mechanist who is pushing an emergency stop button. By giving feedback to this controller, a more configuration-independent control can be designed.

And opposite, even control system has broken down, the automatic recovery system of passive type still can be fed back into safe pitch automatically, i.e. the high attack angle pitch.

U. S. Patent 4,435,646 disclose a kind of wind turbine pitch control system, it comprises that a housing has the parallel blade of spacing to transfer the oar axis to be limited in the plane with a pair of, intersect with rotor axis near described two accent oar axis mid points on this plane and machine control unit vane angle angle when initiatively determining to turn round.This device has the defective of most existing wind eddies wheel pitch control systems.

Fig. 6 is the wind turbine that is provided with pitch control hub of the present invention, and its predicted power is with respect to the curve of wind speed.

Fig. 1 shows the installation diagram of the contrary wind stabilized deflection double-leaf wind turbine that uses with the synchronous generator coupled of power utilization network.A tower seat 10 is supported liftoff about 70 feet horizontal revolving stage assembly parts 12.A loader 14 is installed on the turntable assembly parts 12, around the vertical axis of turntable assembly parts 12, does the rotation of deflection direction.Install on the loader 14 and rotate axle housing 16, with the hollow rotatingshaft 17 of high moment of torsion of shell 16 supporting the insides.

The front end of double runner rotor 18 and transmission shaft is connected, the transmission shaft rear end connects a pair of induction generator 22 and 24 by gear-box 20, and generator can be done the optimization running respectively under the height wind friction velocity, thereby rotor can be rotated by two corresponding designing requirements under optimum operation speed.Be installed in the free wheel device (not shown) on the gearbox output shaft, can reduce the number of power system control loop and relay box, thereby increase the entire life of equipment, and reduce maintenance.The connection that unidirectional free wheel device can improve alternator/electrical network with separate.

Rotor 18 has a hub 28 that is generally rectangle, as shown in Figure 4, rotates on transmission axis a.Two identical wind turbine blades 30 and 32 are installed on the hub 28.In specified 100 kilowatts design, the diameter of rotor blade is about 58 feet.Desirable blade has the zero degree tapering, is provided with elasticity and waves hub.The two speed runnings (48/72 commentaries on classics/per minute) that are designed to of rotor should starting automatically under about 7 miles/speed hourly.The tip speed ratio of design is 7-9.

Fig. 2-4 shows the details of hub 28.Hub 28 has pair of cylinders bearing 34 and 36, and sharf 38 and 40 is bearing in the inside respectively and can rotates, and cylindrical bearing 34 and 36 determines blade to transfer the position of oar axis b and c respectively.Circle eccentric mounting flange 42 and 44 connects the opposite end that blade is transferred oar axle 38 and 40 respectively.Blade 30 and 32(Fig. 1) flange 46 and 48 that matches is with it arranged, be installed on flange 42 and 44 with bolt respectively.

The box-shaped pipe stull 50 and 52 that bearing cylinder 34 and 36 usefulness are welded with it forms a firm rigidity square frame.Rotor shaft 17 is connected with hub, shown in Fig. 3 and 4.Mounting bracket 54 will wave hub assembly parts 55 and box-shaped pipe 50 and 52 is rigidly connected.A gear-box 60 is on bearing cylinder 34 and 36 respective end.Quaternate spur wheel 60 is installed in the gear-box and rotates, shown in Fig. 1 and 4.Prototype pitch circle diameter is 9 inches.Two actuation gears 62 and 64 are being transferred coaxial installation on oar axle 38 and 40.Eccentric mounting flange 42 is connected with spur wheel 62.Two shaftgears 62 and 64 connect with a pair of driving gear 66 and 68 and to do transmission, the plane bias that they are bearing in the gear-box 60 and axis b and c form, as shown in Figure 4.

On the end in addition of bearing cylinder 34 and 36, axis is connected by a rotation biasing member, and the identical crank throw of a pair of placement direction 70 and 72 is arranged in these parts, is rigidly connected with accent oar axle 38 and 40 respectively.Crank throw 72 and eccentric mounting flange 44 cast solids can be cast when needing.Crank throw 70 and 72 outer end and hydraulic linear actuator 74 are done pivotally connected, and actuator 74 has cylinder body 76, do pivotally connectedly with crank throw 70, and piston rod 78 slides in cylinder, does pivotally connected with crank throw 72.In order to make design compact as far as possible, crank throw preferably stretches towards the circular mounting flange, and direction is identical with the knuckle core of gear-box 60, and as shown in Figure 2, linear actuators 74 can be established spring bias voltage propelling piece when needing.

Hydraulic system such as Fig. 5 letter are shown.Hydraulic pipe line passes with one heart towards gear-box 20 in rotor transmission shaft, connects by the gentle pressure accumulator of a swivel joint pipe fitting, and other assemblies are installed in the deflection loader 14, as shown in Figure 5.Just hydraulic fluid is freely led to oil groove when forwarding to valve on the closed position, make centrifugal force the complete feathering of blade.

Hydraulic system among Fig. 5 is used to control pitch actuator 74, makes two blades regulate about 70 ° between feathering and working state.During running, the accent oar moment that the airload on centrifugal force and the blade causes is tended to piston rod is extracted out from linear actuator.This moment increases with wind speed, and direction is identical with wind direction.A bladder air charged accumulator 80 is arranged, absorb the accent oar moment that piston rod 78 elongations cause and extrude the liquid of linear actuator.Gas-filling bag plays spring action, absorbs the power of aerodynamic moment, thereby the restoring moment that increases is provided, and blade is sent back on the working state.

Some element of hydraulic system is placed in the NEMA4 case (NEMA is a U.S. National Electrical Manufacturer Association) as shown in Figure 5

There are four kinds of programs in this system:

A. pressurized start program;

B. load is transferred pitch to feathering down;

C. transfer pitch to working state during off-load;

D. rapid feathering (instruction is stopped).

Shut-off valve 82 cuts out during energising, and electric-motor pump 84 startings increase to running pressure with system pressure.Gas spring pressure in the accumulator 80 and liquid stock balance, linear actuator 76 retreat on the starting position (in Fig. 5 and working state position opposite) fully.When reaching running pressure, pump 84 makes it motionless through pressure switch 86.Pump starting when needing is to keep the system pressure of pressure switch area requirement.But when pump quit work, check valve 88 and hydraulic system were isolated.

In program B (pitch turns to feathering under load), the accent oar moment of the centrifugal force when wind speed increases in the turbo driving and aerodynamic increase is tended to piston rod 78 is extracted out from linear actuator 76.The liquid that linear actuator is discharged will be passed through oil hydraulic circuit, suck accumulator 80, bleed valve 90 be arranged, quick-break device 92, the oil hydraulic circuit that passes through from turbine shaft 17 and swivel joint 94, quick-break device 96, check valve 98, quick-break device 100 and decompressor 102 in the loop.Liquid stock increase the gas spring pressure and the system pressure that will increase in the accumulator 80.The accumulator size requirement should be able to absorb the storage under the highest system pressure.Liquid from linear actuator inflow accumulator tends to the rotor blade feathering.

In program C when off-load (on the blade pitch change) to operating condition, the hydraulic fluid reverse flow.When the accent oar moment on the blade reduced because of wind speed, the gas elastic force in the accumulator 80 provided control force, and linear actuator 74 is returned on the working position.This control force is in operating mode B, because of length of spring compressed is stored.When spring when state of equilibrium is return, liquid is discharged from accumulator, by check valve 98, through identical oil hydraulic circuit, enters actuator by valve 104.

Program B and C often occur during turbo driving.Because flowage friction and actuator friction cause the loss of stored energy, just pump must be started, and keep the pressure in the system.

Program D(makes the rapid feathering of shutdown) be by with solenoid valve 82 outages, hydraulic fluid row is obtained to liquid storage tank 106.Because centrifugal force or aerodynamic force feathering moment, the liquid that linear actuator 76 is discharged by solenoid valve 82, enters liquid storage tank through check valve 98.The liquid stream of discharging from accumulator also is introduced into liquid storage tank.Pump 84 must be reset recovery system pressure after the shutdown.

Increase wind-force load and cause blade moment to rise on blade, it reverses and transfers the oar axle.This moment of torsion that increases will run into the resistance that linear actuators 74 more strengthens.Wind-force load is big more, and the control moment of blade is also big more, and blade just is more prone to feathering.

As among Fig. 6 about shown in the curve of this programme, the power curve of being done comprises the scope of 7 to 30 miles per hour wind speed.In linear actuators 74, increase a spring, can make the envelope of curve broadening of running.The shape of curve, peak output output flat segments curve and shutdown tilting section power curve are decided by that all the pitch that changes with wind speed changes program.Two recline pressure curves are represented the design standard of Passive Control, and Passive Control can adopt fluid power, or in the load control area, increase the combination of spring bias voltage.The blade pitch angle approximative value curve representation of Passive Control.

The blade pitch controller is a passive mechanical device, makes blade in transferring the oar degrees of freedom, seek the equilibrium position voluntarily when condition changes.Some accent oar moments are comprehensive, the pitch equilibrium code of decision rotor.Blade profile, biasing of blade thrust and the biasing of blade centrifugal force produce transfers oar moment, its vector and decision pitch equilibrium code, the pitch equilibrium code determines the power curve feature again, the size of each moment and variation, can be by the scrupulous blade center of gravity axis of placing, the biasing of control axis and aerodynamic force axis etc. and in advance to change.The Eulerian angle of axis of runner blade are inswept cone angle, when performing an analysis and wave all no less importants of angle △ 1 and △ 3 of dynamically pulling back.

This passive rotor control system utilize wind-force and blade intrinsic be used to power, change the pitch of rotor automatically, at fitful wind, strong wind and zero load protection turbine down.Select suitable gas spring, can be with the rotor pitched on given position, to obtain maximum power curve.Reliability that the automatic rotor hub provides and level of security can be saved break, but the weathercock manually-operable.

The gear of transferring gear 62 on the oar axle and 64 the most handy hot hardenings to handle, AGMA(AGMA) the tolerance level is 11.Preferably these gears are being transferred hot jacket installation on the oar axle, the mounting flange of rotor blade is done adjustable installation with circular cone anchor clamps (not shown) on gear and axle, and the adjustable pine of anchor clamps makes blade can do ten/once "" timing "", tightens then.But idler gear push-and-pull and rotation are to mesh new tooth.Because idler gear is replaceable, so can use the metal manufacturing softer, adapt to wearing and tearing than end gear, preferably free gear is installed on the eccentric part for ease of regulating.

The extreme stress alternation of dimensional range double-leaf wind turbine during the design of this hub can be handled, dimensional range are 50 to 80 feet.Leaf weight increases with the cube of radius.Gravity load on hub and the blade is when blade rotates the rotation of sub-axis, with the change in orientation of blade.In addition, because the center of gravity of blade is at the rear of transferring the oar axis, the gravity item has the less important alternation effect relevant with angle to the pitch angle.The loading off-load of this alternation is born by the design of rigid mount hub.

With the angular velocity square centrifugal force item that is directly proportional, more important than aerodynamic force item in design, rotating speed is transferred in the oar moment at blade reflected.

If needed, the different accumulator of available some pressure, available one or more actuators are handled different load ranges.Yet single actuator/single accumulator can show as all pitch controlling Design of summary of an exquisiteness.

Except that normal operation shown in Figure 6, pitch control hub also can compensate the loss of fitful wind and electric load.Fitful wind is reflected as because the increase of the nose-down pitching moment that the control axis bias causes on blade.This just causes the corresponding direct variation of propeller pitch angle, by blade be used to the power correction, discharge the moment of flexure of blade.The passive spring assembly of pitch control hub can not produce the instantaneous peak value moment of flexure of high torque peak and blade, and make it to reduce by the corresponding passive release of fitful wind load.

Just produce the corresponding hypervelocity of rotor along with the reduction of load.The hypervelocity that the design of passive type rotor also can cause load decline is controlled in the safety margin.At last, use passive pitch control hub also can save complicated electronic control logical circuit, the sensor that cooperatively interacts and be difficult to check and the feedback loop of running program complexity.With telescopic hydraulic pressure leverage, form direct and effective override capability at blade pitch load and gas spring chien shih, further improve the reliability of system.Feathering by blade provides automatic and manual shutdown function, just need not increase braking member or control unit.

Above-mentioned embodiment purpose is only for narrating not for to limit.Can do many variations and increase and decrease to the system that discloses and not break away from the principle and the spirit of invention.For example can be to spur wheel 62,64,66 and 68 power train changes on demand, produces and the direct-connected contrary rotation of blade.And train of gearings and linear actuators can change along the position of transferring oar axis b and c.If any enough spaces, also power train can be placed on other positions, for example be placed on hub in the heart, one (as shown) or a plurality of linear actuators are connected with crank throw on the blade axle head that stretches out the bearing cylinder.Also can do other modification to hydraulic system.A for example available double acting cylinder is initiatively shifted blade onto all-cis oar state when needing.In any case scope of the present invention is decided by the accompanying Claim book.

Claims (19)"
19,"Description
  The present invention relates to a method of generating electric power by converting eolical energy of mechanical energy under controlled conditions to generate electric power, an apparatus provided for such electric power generation, and The present invention relates to a rotor that can stably supply power regardless of wind speed.

  A conventional eolical converter rotates in a vertical direction in parallel with an equipment sustaining post and is connected to a vertical axis and is perpendicular to the post. It is characterized by having a helix structure that is directly connected to the shaft of the generator or the shaft of the generator.

  Such a spiral structure rotates exclusively by the action of a component (part) of wind power. Here, the angle change in the step is provided in a direction perpendicular to the wind direction. Besides that, the aerodynamic surface of a spiral shovel is just a single component of wind power, so if compared to a circle defined by motion, It has a very small area. However, the use of such a configuration limits the advantages that are obtained when several helical structures are used to propel the shaft in a square meter space that receives wind.

  Helical structures were developed to displace or displace a large amount of air. In short, it is a structure provided to move the wind at a position that is almost ineffective but not to be moved by the wind.

  The problem is more serious when using a shell structure. That is because the outer structure has the same aerodynamic surface in (your) front part and back part with different resistance coefficients. The resulting wind power is very small, thereby further reducing its effectiveness in the method of acquiring or collecting wind power.

  A further problem with conventional converters is that the rotation is directly proportional to the velocity of the incident wind. Here, it is impossible to control the angular speed of the shaft. In this way, the energy generated from the generators built into these converters is variable, which is not suitable for the purpose of generating energy on a large scale.

  Also, related art is related to converters having plates or blades fixed to a horizontal shaft that rotates a vertical shaft. These blades are fixed to a horizontal shaft, whereby the blades are divided into two parts each having different dimensions. Of the two parts, one part is above the shaft and the other part is below the shaft. When wind hits the front blade, it becomes vertical and rotates the main shaft. When the vane reaches a position where the wind hits your (your) back, it rotates in the horizontal direction so as not to create resistance to the wind. However, such a mechanism is generally not efficient, but if the vanes are arranged to move backwards with respect to the wind, i.e. when arranged in a horizontal position, the vanes above the horizontal shaft This part uses wind power against the moving position, and as a result provides resistance (to the vanes). Therefore, a larger area or region below the horizontal shaft is required to allow wind power to move the vanes. This can significantly reduce the amount of wind power required to transmit the rotational force to the main shaft in the vertical direction, but results in a position that is moving (flagged position) and a position that does not move (unflagged). When the region that provides resistance to the position) is compared with the entire region, the amount of conversion (conversion amount) of the rotational energy is very small. In short, it can be said that this system is not as efficient as the helical system. In addition, there is a demerit that the area of reception for pushing the shaft to generate a large amount of energy has to be extended considerably, which is the size of the blade (width) ), Which prevents the horizontal shaft (in the middle) rotating with the vanes from having a meaningful dimension from a structural or functional point of view. In addition, this system cannot be used when generating energy on a large scale, but it also allows the support system to be mounted in the horizontal direction to support a large load once the plate is fixed as a result of the above movement. This is because it cannot be applied to other shafts.

  In order to solve the problems of the prior art, it has been proposed to manufacture the blades with materials having different weights, so that the superior part of the blade is lighter than the inferior part of the blade. . However, this assumption only applies if the vanes are placed horizontally. The heavier lower part requires more wind power to move it horizontally. However, various problems arise when the weights of the upper and lower blades are reversed.

  A further problem in systems for generating energy on a large scale is the absence of a controller that moves the plate closer to or away from the main shaft that allows effective rotational control to compensate for changes in wind speed.

  In light of the problems in the prior art, the air converter of the present invention includes a system that generates power by wind power, which is not yet known at all. While -98% is used (such utilization varies with wind speed), it is possible to use various levels of plates without any limitation on the size of the plate. Thereby, one propeller shaft having a large area for receiving wind power is provided. Here, the propeller shaft provides controlled and tuned performance, usually on a large scale, without any change, vibration and noise in embodiments with higher loads. In addition, when the wind is not sufficient for a certain period of time, a so-called hybrid system is provided with a combination of an air system generator and a combustion motor and an automatic energy exchange system that assumes a case where the wind is stopped. It is also possible.

  The present invention provides an apparatus having safety against strong winds and storms.

  In the technology used to receive wind power, the vertical axis is rotated by the wind power. When the wind hits a planar aerodynamic plate, this plate rotates horizontally (so-called circular motion). The aerodynamic surface does not have a shape like a shell structure or a spiral structure, but is composed of a planar plate having a quadrangular or rectangular shape (when viewed from the planar shape). The plate is also made of a material that is thin, very light and can withstand wind pressure.

  Such a plate is secured to the horizontal shaft by a hinge system or other device. Other devices referred to herein refer to devices that allow the plate to perform quarter circle movement. Here, the hinge is fixed to the upper part of the plate (superior part), fixed to the horizontal shaft, and controlled by a servo motor. Thereby it is possible to move the aerodynamic plate towards the main vertical shaft or away from the shaft so as to control the deviation of the wind speed.

  When receiving wind power at the front, this aerodynamic plate is in a vertical position and produces traction, but when receiving wind power at its back, this plate stands from almost horizontal. , Thereby providing maximum aerodynamic resistance. In this system, the plate does not have any aerodynamic resistance caused by the wind force, but utilizes 100% of the wind force to pull or move the plate depending on its position relative to the wind direction. Here, the degree of utilization (utilization) of wind force in the conversion / conversion of mechanical rotational energy depends exclusively on the wind speed and the weight of the plate.

  The horizontal rotational group is provided on a vertical structural tubular post. This post consists of several horizontal aerodynamic plates placed on several different levels in the vertical direction and at different angles on the vertical axis to increase the final effectiveness. May include a group of Here (when structurally) the number of the groups is determined, the size of the aerodynamic surface of the plate will depend on the amount of energy required to achieve the purpose of using the system.

  A vertical vertical shaft is fixed on a support structure post fixed to the ground. An external vertical rotating shaft to which such a structure is fixed is an internal shaft fixed to the ground or higher structure under conditions that are inclined towards the plate that receives the wind. Acts on a scouring pad or bearing fixed to an internal structural post to form a more tempered turbulent wind layer, with its lower end being a power generator or other A gear system or pulley coupled to the desired rotating device. Here, the diameter of the gears and / or pulleys, whose size is larger or smaller, is determined by a multiplication factor that increases the speed of the propeller shaft, and in part, the desired average speed It depends on the requirements of the generator manufacturer or the instruction manual that specifies the conditions for obtaining the correct relationship with the (rotation medium).

  When it is necessary to obtain a more accurate and higher average speed, not only automatically increase or decrease the angular velocity to compensate for wind speed deviations, but also the largest gear at the base of the shaft. By adding an integrated inertial disk steering wheel, the aerodynamic plate is moved towards or away from the vertical rotary shaft to increase the inertia of the rotational movement A servo-motor is used to make it move. In such a case, if necessary, the servo motor may be used in combination with a specific reel or design in order to efficiently control the resistance in the direction against rotation and increase the rotation speed. good. In this case, a message is sent to the control unit through the servo motor to reposition the aerodynamic plate moving away from the main shaft. On the other hand, if the wind speed in the direction of bringing the plate closer to the main shaft drops, the motor can no longer perform the resistance function, and the rotational speed decreases as the plate approaches the shaft. To prevent this, the combustion motor starts to operate using a battery preloaded by the one-way system, for example under conditions where no wind power is supplied for 3 minutes.

  By using the apparatus according to the present invention, it is possible to supply power stably regardless of the wind speed.

  For better understanding of the present invention, two examples are shown below, but the present invention is not limited to these examples.

  The first embodiment of the present invention has been proposed to generate energy on a small or large scale. Such a structure allows 90-98% of the wind power to be converted into mechanical rotational energy and provides several different levels of plates without limiting the size of the plates. This is a wind collection (or wind acquisition) system. Here, in order to provide a wide wind receiving area for rotating the shaft even when the wind speed is low, a profiler shaft having a wide area is provided. The system does not have to be placed in the wind direction because its traction is always in a programmed direction so that it rotates regardless of the wind direction. It has a device that can rotate and control the rotation. This device achieves the above function mainly by a cylindrical vertical hollow cover (1), and specifically, the aerodynamic plate (2) has the cover (1). ) Or a direction away from the cover (1). The system comprises a cylindrical vertical hollow cover (1); an aerodynamic plate (2) provided for controlled angular movement and movement; a structured horizontal arm (3); Structural clamping cable (4); Horizontal rotating shaft (5); Servo motor (6) to move aerodynamic plate; Servo motor (7) to rotate aerodynamic plate; For rotating aerodynamic plate Aerodynamic plates rotation motor shaft (8); aerodynamic plate shock absorber (9); rotating inertial loading steering wheel (10); steering wheel rack (11) ); Generator bevel gear (12); RPM multiplier box (13); elastic coupling ) (14); alternating current generator (15); coupling hydraulic clutch with elastic glove (16); combustion motor (17); electromagnetic Starter electromagnetic motor (18) with brake and accelerator; rotation sensor (19); central control management system (20); surface bearing (21) and support bearing (22); cylinder Shaped vertical post (23). Here, the aerodynamic plate (2) is fixed to the horizontal shaft (5) so that the plate allows a quarter-circle movement (partial circle movement), and the plate (2) Also moves in both directions in which the horizontal shaft (5) extends, allowing the angular velocity of the cover (1) to be kept constant. The horizontal arm (3) is fixed to the cover (1) to form a crossbar (24). Since the crossbars (24) are arranged on each horizontal plane, the angle between them is a 90 degree angle divided by the number of crossbars used.

  The cover (1) is inserted into the top of the structural post (23) and is held by surface bearings and support bearings (22), so that the cover (1) provides little resistance in angular motion, It is possible to freely rotate around the post. The post (23) can be fixed directly to the ground using conventional techniques. Since such a converter system can work more effectively at altitudes where the wind is more uniform, the converter posts and other structures can be fixed on the construction. Thereby, the converter (position) can be raised before reaching the ideal working altitude. In this way, the requirement that the post (23) and cover (1) configurations be at the same height as the ideal working height can be avoided. For example, if a wind blows at a certain location at an altitude of 100 metres, the converter can be secured to the 50 mettle configuration, post (23) and cover (1). These posts (23) and cover (1) may have an altitude of approximately 50 metres instead of 100 metres. Thereby, the configuration of the converter becomes lighter and the burden is reduced.

Although the aerodynamic plate (2) is connected to a horizontal rotating shaft (5) through threads support (thread support, 25), the threat support (25) is a servo motor (
The plate (2) is moved in both directions of the shaft (5) by driving the movement of 6) and the rotation of the plate (2). Here, when wind power is received at these front portions, the plate is held in a vertical position and a horizontal arm (3) that rotates the cover (1).
) Is generated. When the aerodynamic plates (2) receive wind at the back, they stand in a substantially horizontal position (moving position) and can perform a quarter circle movement. The aerodynamic plate (2) is planar and is laminated so that it can be easily replaced against wind power when moving or returning to a vertical position, whereby Move the horizontal arm (3)
As a result, the cover (1) is rotated. The cover (1) rotates the inertial load steering wheel (10), and this rotational motion (or rotational force) is applied to the slope wheel (12) of the generator connected to the steering wheel rack (11). To communicate. In this way, the horizontal rotational movement of the plate (2) caused by the wind is already appropriately increased by the RPM multiplier box (13), consistent with the characteristics of the alternator (15), and this rotation. It is transmitted to the generator (15) that accepts the movement. RPM multiplier box (13) and generator (
15) is connected via an elastic coupling (14), but such an elastic coupling (14) does not cause any damage to the rotating shaft of the generator (15). ) To transmit the rotational motion. However, the other tip of the generator (15) (ex
Since the rotating shaft of the generator is connected to tremity), it is connected to the combustion motor (17) via a coupling hydraulic clutch having an elastic glove (16). Such a clutch (16) is centered when there is little or no wind, when the wind is very weak, or when there is enough wind to keep the generator (15) rotating. Operated by the control management system (20). However, before the combustion motor (17) is started, the system starts the electromagnetic motor (18) and keeps the rotation of the converter constant. If the wind is not normal, the combustion motor (17) is started and the electromagnetic motor (18) is turned off after a predetermined time.

  The aerodynamic plate (2) may be composed of metal material, plastic, synthetic fiber, or woven fabric. The material preferably has waterproofness, weather resistance, light resistance, and the like. However, any material having wind resistance stability (or wind resistance) can be used in the present invention without being limited to the above materials.

  Since the aerodynamic plate has a highly rigid frame made of a light material, it is possible to hold the rigid plate under conditions of wind pressure. Examples of the material include metal, metallic league, aluminum, carbon fiber, iron, steel, or plastic.

  The aerodynamic plate (2) is provided to support the horizontal arm (3) leading to the servo motor (7). When strong wind blows, the servo motor (7) rotates and moves the plate (2) with respect to the horizontal direction.

  The horizontal shaft (5) has a thread like an endless screw and is connected to a moving servo motor (6). This servomotor (6) moves the aerodynamic plate (2) towards or away from the cover (1) in a clockwise and counterclockwise direction (counterclockwise). The horizontal shaft (5) is rotated in this manner to maintain the angular speed of the inertial load steering wheel (10), thereby keeping the speed of the generator (15) constant.

  The pensil type, self-sustained horizontal arm (3) is tubular, has a lattice-type structure and is connected to the cover (1). The horizontal arm (3) may also be held by a steel cable provided between the tip of the arm (3) and the cover (1) not having the lattice structure. This horizontal arm (3) is connected to each other via a steel cable to give the group of arms (3) greater rigidity and stability in the same plane forming the crossbar (24).

  The horizontal arm (3) is provided with a shock absorber (9). This shock absorber (9) softens the angular motion of the aerodynamic plate (2) and absorbs the wind force applied to the plate (2) without causing any damage to the plate (2), thereby It minimizes the impact on the towing position or moving position.

  The cylindrical cover (1) is provided with an inertial load steering wheel (10) at the lower end (inferior extremity). This inertial load steering wheel (10) transmits and transmits to the generator bevel gear (12) and the bevel gear of the electromagnetic motor (18) in the RPM multiplier box (13) in order to control rotation and starting. Rack (11).

  The alternator (15) generates a constant amount of power (exit) without floating the cycle (absence of flotation of the cycle). As a result, a well-balanced cover by controlling the distance from the cover (1) to the aerodynamic plate (2) and / or the inclination of the plate (2) and the control device of the electromagnetic motor (18). A constant rotation (movement) of (1) is obtained without noise.

  The converter is provided with a combustion motor (17), and the rotation of the generator (15) can be kept constant even if a weak wind blows or a strong wind such as a storm blows. Instead of this combustion motor, the energy of an existing electric circuit may be used.

  The electromagnetic motor (18) serves to eliminate the system of the inertia when starting the converter when the momentary wind is not strong enough to propel the converter. Such a motor (18) also has a magnetic brake that increases or decreases the load or traction on the inertial load steering wheel (10) (without reducing the rotational speed). ) May be provided with an auxiliary device necessary for controlling the cover (1) to rotate constantly.

  The rotation sensor (19) monitors the rotation of the inertial load steering wheel (10), which functions as a parameter for controlling the constant speed of the generator (15), rotates a desired pattern, and stores energy in the interior. Guarantee that it will occur.

  Management of the converter is performed by a central control management system (20). This central control management system (20) manages the energy generated by the generator (15) and generates a constant power through the drive of the motors (6), (7), (17) and / or (18). It is possible to hold the quantity. In order to do so, feedback of the instantaneous current, the instantaneous tension and the instantaneous information of the rotation sensor (19) generated from the generator (15) is required. Although not shown, a known type sensor can be used as a sensor for measuring the current and tension generated from the generator (15).

  The device provided at the base (base) of the converter for controlling and managing the generated energy is protected by a cover that prevents it from hitting rain or the sun.

  The second embodiment for the air converter allows 90% to 98% of the wind to be converted to rotational mechanical energy to illustrate an example applicable in coastal areas and the like. It has a wind collection (wind acquisition) system. Also, by providing several different levels of plates, the efficiency is increased so that the system does not need to be turned according to the direction of the wind. This is because the traction force of the converter always rotates in a predetermined direction regardless of the wind direction.

  This converter comprises a cylindrical vertical post (23); a planar aerodynamic plate (2); a horizontal shaft (26); a vertical rotary shaft (27); a bearing for a rotary group (28); vertical rotary shaft bearing (29); pulleys (30), (31), (32) and (33); continuous current generator (34); control circuit (35); Sensor (36); Reactor (37); Battery (38); Conductor (39); Lamp (40); Post-fixing base (41); Post-fixing base cover (42); and rotation It has a group (43). Here, the aerodynamic plate is fixed to the horizontal shaft through the hinge, whereby one surface of the hinge (44) is fixed to the lower part (inferior part) of the horizontal shaft (26), and the hinge (44 ) Is fixed to the upper part of the plate (2) and the horizontal shaft (26) is fixed to the rotating group (43), so that the crossbar (45) is formed. Also, these crossbars are provided on each horizontal plane so that the angle between them is a 90 ° angle divided by the number of crossbars used.

  In this embodiment, for example, the rotation group (43) is provided with four or more crossbars (45). In this case, the angle between the crossbars is 22.5 °. If four different levels of crossbars, fewer than four crossbars, or more than four crossbars are used, the angle is 90 ° divided by the number of crossbars.

  The rotating group (43) is inserted into the top of the post (23) and is held by the bearing (28) of the rotating group. Here, the bearing (28) is provided so as to freely rotate around the post.

  The horizontal shaft (26) is provided with two piece stoppers at an angle of 80 ° to each other so that one of the two pieces is 90 ° to the horizontal shaft (26). The plate (2) is supported and can hold their vertical position when receiving wind from the front, to maximize the contact surface with the wind and make better use of the wind To do. Another piece (the remaining one of the two pieces) makes an angle of 10 ° with the horizontal shaft (26) and this is when the wind hits the back of the aerodynamic plate (2) It is in a substantially horizontal position, and the angle of 10 ° is quickly lowered when the plate (2) returns to its original position by the wind and returns to the vertical position, propelling the rotating group.

  The stopper (46) is in partial contact with the plate and is covered with an absorbent material so as to reduce the impact between the plate (2) and the stopper (46). With such a configuration, the plate (2) is protected.

  The aerodynamic plate (2) is planar and relatively thin (thickness). The plate may be made of a metal material, plastic, synthetic fiber, or woven fabric so as to withstand wind. The material preferably has waterproofness, weather resistance, light resistance, and the like. However, any material having wind resistance stability (or wind resistance) can be used in the present invention without being limited to the above materials. This light plate (2) is easily lifted when the wind hits its back. The plate is preferably thin.

  The aerodynamic plate may have a rigid frame made of a light material, for example, aluminum, carbon fiber, plastic, etc. with high resistance and low weight characteristics.

  The post (2) is fixed to the post fixing base (41) through a welded portion or the like in the reinforcing ring (47). These post fixing bases (41) are composed of four tubular supports and a reinforcing ring (47). This reinforcing ring (47) connects the supports together, so that the angle between the supports is 90 °.

  Tubular supports have knees that can have an angular range of 20 ° to 45 °, depending on the size of the base on which they are to be provided.

  The vertical rotary shaft (27) extends from the top of the post even after the base of the post is inclined to the subscript plate (48), and each tip of the vertical rotary shaft (27). Is provided with a bearing (29). These bearings are provided so that a vertical rotary shaft (27) can freely rotate. The pulley (30) is fixed to the lower end (inferior extremity) of the vertical rotary shaft (27) which transmits its rotational force to the smaller transmission / transmission pulley (31). In the shaft, the pulley (31) is larger than the transmission pulley (32), but the transmission pulley (32) transmits the rotational force to the pulley (33) of the generator. If pulleys are present, they can be replaced by gears that increase rotation.

  Since the generator (34) adopts such a configuration, it may be a continuous average type or an AC generator.

  The energy generated by the continuous current generator (34) is managed by a control circuit (35) connected to the continuous current generator (34). Here, the control circuit is connected to a continuous current generator (34), a brightness sensor (36), a reactor (37), a battery for energy transmission / reception (38) and sends energy exclusively. It is connected to a lamp (40) that plays a role. These batteries (38) are manufactured with dimensions (or external shapes) that match the characteristics of the wind at the place where the converter is installed, or have such dimensions (or external shapes), and are one hour or longer. It may have a size or an external shape that can perform its original function even when the wind does not blow.

  The conducting wire (39) is provided on the inner wall of the post (23) and has a function of connecting the reaction furnace (37) to the lamp (40).

  Once installed, the air converter operates in the presence of wind, for example, when the wind hits a plate on surface A (see FIG. 7), the rotating group (43 ) Rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. The plate on side B is tilted substantially horizontally (not shown) and provides a resistance of about 1 to 5% of the wind value. In this way, the plate on surface B reaches surface A. With an angle of 10 °, the wind pushes them down, causing them to be in a vertical position, thereby moving the rotating group (43) and the like.

  The rotating group (43) rotates at an inclination to the bearing and transmits its rotational force to the vertical rotating shaft (27) through the pulleys (30), (31), (32) and (33). The pulley transmits rotational force to a continuous current generator (34), thereby generating electric power. This energy is then supplied to the control circuit (35), which changes the state of the brightness sensor (36). If the sensor indicates a low brightness level, i.e. at night or a cloudy day, the control circuit supplies power to the reactor (37) and the tension applied to the lamp (40). Increase (tension). In addition, the control circuit (35) supplies power to the battery (38) so that they maintain a load condition. The control circuit (35) monitors the load condition of the battery (38) and stops the supply of energy when it is detected that they are loaded, thereby causing an overload or premature discharge of the battery (38). The present situation such as waste) is prevented. If the sensor indicates that the brightness level is low, but the generator does not generate energy because of a lack of wind, the control circuit supplies the energy of the battery (38) to the reactor (37), thereby Turn on the lamp. The generated energy is used for other systems such as residential systems.

BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
This invention relates to a fan assembly.

An important application of the fan assembly of the invention is extraction of air from a building space or from ducting. In a specific application, the fan assembly may be mounted in or on the roof of a building to extract air from the building space below or from ducting in the building. A known fan assembly which is currently used in such applications is the so-called “Whirlybird”, the main component of which is essentially a Savonius drag-type turbine. The turbine serves both to catch the wind and to extract air. Although fan assemblies of this type are in widespread use, they product a negligible pressure differential and are accordingly often unable to overcome the aerodynamic resistance to air flow through the space or ducting.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
According to the present invention there is provided a fan assembly comprising an upright axis wind turbine coupled to a separate, upright axis air extraction or air supply fan to drive the fan.

In the preferred embodiment, there is a vertical axis wind turbine coupled coaxially, with or without intermediate gearing, to the fan. The preferred vertical axis wind turbine is a multi-blade Darrieus or Gyromill-type rotor with symmetrical or cambered aerofoil-profile blades. Start-up torque for the turbine may be provided by an auxiliary helical drag-type turbine, typically a Savonius-type turbine, on the axis of the main turbine.

Preferably the fan itself is a vertical axis, single-inlet fan the impeller of which has backward-curved aerofoil section fan blades.

According to a preferred feature, the assembly includes a rotational speed governor.

Other preferred features of the fan assembly are set forth in the appended claims.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
The fan assembly 10 seen in FIG. 1 has, as its major components, a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) 12, an extraction fan 14 arranged coaxially with the VAWT and a round cylindrical duct 16. As shown in FIG. 3, the fan 14 is mounted on the duct 16 which is in use secured to a roof 18 with the interior of the duct in communication with a space 20 beneath the roof from which air is to be extracted. The broken lines in FIG. 3 indicate an alternative arrangement in which the duct 16 communicates with an air duct 22 beneath the roof.

The VAWT includes three vertically oriented, aerofoil section turbine blades 26 connected to one another at their lower ends by spars 24. In FIGS. 2 and 6(a) the blades 26 have a cambered aerofoil section while in the alternative configuration seen in FIG. 6(b) the blades have a symmetrical aerofoil section. At an elevated position, the three blades are connected to one another by spars 28. From the centre of each spar 28 a member 30 extends radially towards the axis 32 of the VAWT.

The inner ends of the members 30 are secured to a central shaft 34 on which an auxiliary turbine 36 is mounted between the main turbine blades 26, coaxially with the VAWT 12.

The auxiliary turbine 36 includes a stack of blades 38 which are of semi-circular section and arranged in pairs 40. As shown in FIG. 7, the inner ends of the individual blades in each pair, at each level, are supported by a rod 42 extending diametrically through the shaft 34 while their outer ends are supported by radial extensions 44 of the rod. As will be apparent from FIGS. 1 and 2, the blade pairs 40 are progressively, angularly off-set from one another, and the radius of curvature of the blades decreases, with increasing height in the stack.

The fan 14 includes a series of angularly spaced blades 46 forming an impeller 48. The lower edges of the blades 46 are secured to an annular base plate 50. The base plate 50 is connected to a tubular shaft 52 bolted through brackets 54 to a plate 55 to which the shaft 34 is secured and on which the spars 24 are mounted. The base plate 50 and accordingly the impeller 48 are thus rotationally fast with the VAWT. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the shaft 52 is supported rotationally in bearings 56 relative to a central stub shaft 58 welded at 60 to a spoked frame 62 spanning across the interior of the duct 16.

It will be understood that the VAWT 12 and auxiliary turbine 36 extend above the roof 18 and are exposed to ambient air movements. The auxiliary turbine 36 provides start-up torque to initiate rotation of the VAWT. In this regard it will be noted that the progressive angular offset of the various blade pairs 40 ensures that air movement is picked up by the auxiliary turbine irrespective of the direction of that movement.

The rotation of the VAWT is transferred directly to the fan impeller 48 which accordingly rotates at the same angular speed as the VAWT. Air is drawn axially out of the space 20 (or the duct 22) and is expelled outwardly by the impeller 48.

The use of a VAWT is an important feature of the invention. A turbine of this type has been shown to be tolerant of blustery wind conditions which are typically encountered in built-up areas. Added to this, it is recognised that efficient air extraction is dependent on the tip speed of the fan blades and hence on the rotational speed of the fan impeller. A Darrieus lift-type VAWT as described above can be shown to produce rotational speeds, in similar wind conditions, which are substantially higher than those achievable with a corresponding drag-type turbine. As a matter of design it will be understood that the VAWT will n practice be matched to the fan to achieve the best air extraction efficiency.

As further illustrated in FIG. 1, it is also possible to increase the tip speed of the impeller blades by including step-up gearing 63 between the VAWT and the fan impeller, although it is recognized that a gearbox may itself cause some overall loss of efficiency.

Referring to FIG. 4, it will be seen that the impeller blades 46 are backwardly curved. By this is meant that for the indicated direction of rotation of the impeller, each blade 46 curves outwardly and away from the direction of forward motion. This features reduces the radial component of the motion which is imparted to the extracted air. Also, with backwardly curved impeller blades the impeller presents a minimal obstruction to the flow of air through the fan, and accordingly allows an acceptable air flow, induced merely by buoyancy of warm air relative to cool air in the space 22, to take place when there is insufficient air movement to rotate the VAWT at a meaningful speed.

In order to reduce the overall mass and hence rotational inertia of the VAWT and fan, it is preferred that these components, and in particular their blades, be made of aluminium. Another possibility under consideration is a lightweight balsa wood frame covered by a thin skin of appropriately tough material.

The cambered aerofoil profile seen in FIG. 6(a) is in general preferred to the symmetrical design of FIG. 6(b) since the cambered shape can be expected to provide some initial start-up torque to assist the auxiliary turbine to initiate rotation of the VAWT.

Referring to FIG. 3 it will be seen that members 60 are suspended on hinges 62 from a conical inlet 64 of the impeller 48. The members 60 carry respective brake shoes 66 at their ends. During rotation of the turbine and fan impeller, the members 60 will swing outwardly as indicated by the arrows 68, the extent of such swinging movement being dependent on the rotational speed and hence the centrifugal force. In high winds where excessive rotational speeds would otherwise be generated, the brake shoes 66 make frictional contact with the internal surface of the duct 16 to govern the rotational speed to within acceptable limits.

The fan assembly in the example described above serves an air extraction function. It will however be appreciated that a fan assembly according to the invention could also be used in an air supply mode. In this case, it would be appropriate to replace the illustrated fan impeller 48 with an axial or mixed flow impeller.

Referring to FIG. 5 it will be seen that the duct 16 is provided with handles 70 for carrying the fan assembly or at least the lower components thereof.

In the embodiment described above and illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 7 the auxiliary turbine has a stepped helical construction. In other embodiments of the invention, one of which is described below, the auxiliary turbine can have a continuous helical shape.

FIGS. 8 to 19 illustrate a second embodiment of fan assembly, indicated generally by the numeral 100, according to the invention. The basic components of the assembly are the same as those of the first embodiment 10 described above. In this case the VAWT 102 has only two diametrically opposed turbine blades or wings 104 as opposed to the three blade configuration of the first embodiment. Each of the blades has a cambered aerofoil shape similar to that illustrated in FIG. 6(a). As illustrated in FIG. 11, each blade is tapered from top to bottom. Referring specifically to FIG. 12, each blade 104 includes an internal framework consisting of an internal spar 106.1, rods 106.2 and 106.3 at the leading and trailing edges rerspectively and a series of internal braces 106.4. The spar, rods and braces are made of carbon fibre. The internal framework is covered by woven glass fibre cloth.

The turbine blades 104 are supported at upper and lower positions by radial spars or spokes 108, 110 respectively. Each spoke includes two aluminium rods 112, 114. As shown in FIG. 15(a) the rods 112 of the upper spokes are parallel to one another. As shown in FIG. 15(b), the rods 114 of the lower spokes 110 are slightly convergent. For improved aerodynamic efficiency, the pairs of rods 112, 114 can be clad in elliptical cladding structures 116 as illustrated in FIG. 16. The spokes 108, 110 are connected to a central shaft 118 by brackets 120, 122.

In the first embodiment, the turbine blades 26 are rigidly connected to the ends of their supporting spars. However in this embodiment, the turbine blades 104 are connected to the ends of the spokes 108, 110 by means of hinges 124 which are illustrated in some detail in FIGS. 13(a) and 13(b). A holed bracket 126 projects inwardly from a transverse plate 128 secured to each blade at each connection point. Projecting outwardly from a transverse plate 130 at the outer end of each spoke is a corresponding holed bracket 132. The brackets 126, 132 are connected pivotally to one another by means of a bolt 134. Acting between the plates 128, 130 at a position to one side of the pivot point, i.e. the axis of the bolt 134, is a compression spring 136. A stop member 138 in the form of a bolt is attached to the plate 130 on the other side of the pivot point and extends towards the plate 128. In the position shown in FIG. 13(a) the spring 136 urges the plate 128 into abutment with the end of the stop member 138. The length of the stop member is set such that in this position of abutment, the associated turbine blade 104 is pitched for optimal aerodynamic efficiency, and the spring tension is selected to ensure that this pitch is maintained during normal operation of the turbine.

The pivot point 134 is off-set relative to the centre of gravity of the turbine blade such that with increasing blade velocity the blade has a tendency to pitch negatively as a result of increased centrifugal force acting on it. At a predetermined blade velocity, the bias of the spring 136 is overcome and the spring is compressed, as illustrated in FIG. 13(b), allowing the blade to assume a negative pitch. This reduces the aerodynamic efficiency of the blade. The negative pitch of the blade increases with increasing rotational velocity of the VAWT until eventually the situation is reached that the blade stalls aerodynamically. The VAWT is accordingly governed to a maximum safe rotational velocity.

It will be understood that the hinged nature of the turbine blades provides the VAWT with an automatically operating aerodynamic rotational speed governor which replaces the centrifugal braking arrangement of the first embodiment.

It will also be noted in FIG. 13(a) that each turbine blade is reinforced by transverse members 140 providing support for the plate 128.

In the second embodiment, the Savonius-type auxiliary turbine of the first embodiment, having the stepped helical construction described above, is replaced by a Savonius-type auxiliary turbine 140 of continuous helical design. Referring to FIG. 18, the auxiliary turbine 140 includes an internal frame 142, of lightweight aluminium or glass-reinfroced plastic material, over which is stretched a skin of wind-impermeable fabric 144. As shown in FIG. 19 the internal frame has a similar configuration to that used in the first embodiment.

The fan 146 of the second embodiment is generally similar to that of the first embodiment and its components are preferably of aluminium or glass-reinforced plastics

As illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 14, the fan assembly 100 includes an outer frustoconical windshield 148 which surrounds the fan 146 and shields it from ambient wind movements. The windshield 148 is mounted on a ring 150 supported by braces 152. Foot support plates 154 project transversely from the ring 150 to provide platforms for personnel to stand on during maintenance or inspection of the fan assembly. In addition the ring also provides a convenient structure for lifting the assembly when necessary and serves as a bumper to protect the assembly during transportation and handling. In addition the ring could be used to support a volute casing to serve as an air supply plenum in those instances where the fan assembly of the invention is used in an air supply mode as opposed to air extraction mode.

Referring to FIG. 14, the fan is surmounted by an upper plate 156 which is of somewhat greater diameter than the fan impeller itself, to prevent ingress of rainwater through the fan. The duct 160 which communicates with the space 162 from which extraction is to take place is typically of mild steel and is provided with a taper to optimise air flow into the fan.

FIG. 14 also illustrates that the fan shaft 164, which in this case rotates in bearings 166 in a casing 168, is extended downwardly to a position well beneath the fan 146 and duct 160. The lower end of the shaft serves as a rotary power take-off and can be used to provide rotary power applications other than air extraction or air supply, such as electrical power generation, grain milling or water pumping.

A lifting eye 170 is provided at the upper end of the central shaft 172 of the VAWT and auxiliary turbine to facilitate mechanical lifting of the fan assembly.

Referring to FIG. 17, the fan assembly 100 also includes a handbrake mechanism 174. This mechanism has a lever 176 pivoted at 178 and carrying a brake pad 180 at one end and a handle 182 at the other end. The handle can be pushed down manually to urge the brake pad 180 upwardly against a plate 182 forming the bottom of the fan impeller thereby to slow down and eventually stop the turbine and fan when maintenance or inspection of the rotary components is necessary. The braking position of the mechanism is illustrated in broken outline.

The mechanism also includes a spring 184 supported loosely on a pin 186. When the handbrake is inoperative the spring merely hangs vertically. However when the handbrake is to be held in an applied condition, for instance during maintenance, the spring is swung upwardly and is hooked onto a pin 188 on the handle to hold the handle down.

Referring again to FIG. 13(b) there is shown, in broken outline, a modification to the turbine speed governor in which the helical compression spring 136 is replaced by a torsion spring 137 which is wrapped around the pivot axis with it ends hooked around detents 139 on the turbine blade 104 and spoke respectively. The spring 137 holds the turbine blade at an efficient orientation at acceptable turbine speeds but will deflects to allow the blade to pitch negatively in the event of excessive turbine speeds due, for instance, to excessively high wind speeds.

The invention also envisages another type of governor in which the turbine blade itself incorporates a control surface which will stand proud of the blade surface, at excessively high rotary speeds, to pitch the blade negatively or slow it down.
